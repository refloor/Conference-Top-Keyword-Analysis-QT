FaceForensics++: Learning to Detect Manipulated Facial Images,"Andreas Rossler, Davide Cozzolino, Luisa Verdoliva, Christian Riess, Justus Thies, Matthias Niessner"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 1-11","The rapid progress in synthetic image generation and manipulation has now come to a point where it raises significant concerns for the implications towards society. At best, this leads to a loss of trust in digital content, but could potentially cause further harm by spreading false information or fake news. This paper examines the realism of state-of-the-art image manipulations, and how difficult it is to detect them, either automatically or by humans. To standardize the evaluation of detection methods, we propose an automated benchmark for facial manipulation detection. In particular, the benchmark is based on Deep-Fakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap and NeuralTextures as prominent representatives for facial manipulations at random compression level and size. The benchmark is publicly available and contains a hidden test set as well as a database of over 1.8 million manipulated images. This dataset is over an order of magnitude larger than comparable, publicly available, forgery datasets. Based on this data, we performed a thorough analysis of data-driven forgery detectors. We show that the use of additional domain-specific knowledge improves forgery detection to unprecedented accuracy, even in the presence of strong compression, and clearly outperforms human observers.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Rossler_FaceForensics_Learning_to_Detect_Manipulated_Facial_Images_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv
DeepVCP: An End-to-End Deep Neural Network for Point Cloud Registration,"Weixin Lu, Guowei Wan, Yao Zhou, Xiangyu Fu, Pengfei Yuan, Shiyu Song"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 12-21","We present DeepVCP - a novel end-to-end learning-based 3D point cloud registration framework that achieves comparable registration accuracy to prior state-of-the-art geometric methods. Different from other keypoint based methods where a RANSAC procedure is usually needed, we implement the use of various deep neural network structures to establish an end-to-end trainable network. Our keypoint detector is trained through this end-to-end structure and enables the system to avoid the interference of dynamic objects, leverages the help of sufficiently salient features on stationary objects, and as a result, achieves high robustness. Rather than searching the corresponding points among existing points, the key contribution is that we innovatively generate them based on learned matching probabilities among a group of candidates, which can boost the registration accuracy. We comprehensively validate the effectiveness of our approach using both the KITTI dataset and the Apollo-SouthBay dataset. Results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable registration accuracy and runtime efficiency to the state-of-the-art geometry-based methods, but with higher robustness to inaccurate initial poses. Detailed ablation and visualization analysis are included to further illustrate the behavior and insights of our network. The low registration error and high robustness of our method make it attractive to the substantial applications relying on the point cloud registration task.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Lu_DeepVCP_An_End-to-End_Deep_Neural_Network_for_Point_Cloud_Registration_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv
Shape Reconstruction Using Differentiable Projections and Deep Priors,"Matheus Gadelha, Rui Wang, Subhransu Maji"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 22-30","We investigate the problem of reconstructing shapes from noisy and incomplete projections in the presence of viewpoint uncertainities. The problem is cast as an optimization over the shape given measurements obtained by a projection operator and a prior. We present differentiable projection operators for a number of reconstruction problems which when combined with the deep image prior or shape prior allows efficient inference through gradient descent. We apply our method on a variety of reconstruction problems, such as tomographic reconstruction from a few samples, visual hull reconstruction incorporating view uncertainties, and 3D shape reconstruction from noisy depth maps. Experimental results show that our approach is effective for such shape reconstruction problems, without requiring any task-specific training.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Gadelha_Shape_Reconstruction_Using_Differentiable_Projections_and_Deep_Priors_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv
Fine-Grained Segmentation Networks: Self-Supervised Segmentation for Improved Long-Term Visual Localization,"Mans Larsson, Erik Stenborg, Carl Toft, Lars Hammarstrand, Torsten Sattler, Fredrik Kahl"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 31-41","Long-term visual localization is the problem of estimating the camera pose of a given query image in a scene whose appearance changes over time. It is an important problem in practice that is, for example, encountered in autonomous driving. In order to gain robustness to such changes, long-term localization approaches often use segmantic segmentations as an invariant scene representation, as the semantic meaning of each scene part should not be affected by seasonal and other changes. However, these representations are typically not very discriminative due to the very limited number of available classes. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network, the Fine-Grained Segmentation Network (FGSN), that can be used to provide image segmentations with a larger number of labels and can be trained in a self-supervised fashion. In addition, we show how FGSNs can be trained to output consistent labels across seasonal changes. We show through extensive experiments that integrating the fine-grained segmentations produced by our FGSNs into existing localization algorithms leads to substantial improvements in localization performance.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Larsson_Fine-Grained_Segmentation_Networks_Self-Supervised_Segmentation_for_Improved_Long-Term_Visual_Localization_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

The 6D camera pose of the query image can be estimated with the predicted scene coordinate map.

Total Denoising: Unsupervised Learning of 3D Point Cloud Cleaning,"Pedro Hermosilla, Tobias Ritschel, Timo Ropinski"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 52-60","We show that denoising of 3D point clouds can be learned unsupervised, directly from noisy 3D point cloud data only. This is achieved by extending recent ideas from learning of unsupervised image denoisers to unstructured 3D point clouds. Unsupervised image denoisers operate under the assumption that a noisy pixel observation is a random realization of a distribution around a clean pixel value, which allows appropriate learning on this distribution to eventually converge to the correct value. Regrettably, this assumption is not valid for unstructured points: 3D point clouds are subject to total noise, i.e. deviations in all coordinates, with no reliable pixel grid. Thus, an observation can be the realization of an entire manifold of clean 3D points, which makes the quality of a naive extension of unsupervised image denoisers to 3D point clouds unfortunately only little better than mean filtering. To overcome this, and to enable effective and unsupervised 3D point cloud denoising, we introduce a spatial prior term, that steers converges to the unique closest out of the many possible modes on the manifold. Our results demonstrate unsupervised denoising performance similar to that of supervised learning with clean data when given enough training examples - whereby we do not need any pairs of noisy and clean training data.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Hermosilla_Total_Denoising_Unsupervised_Learning_of_3D_Point_Cloud_Cleaning_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv
Hierarchical Self-Attention Network for Action Localization in Videos,"Rizard Renanda Adhi Pramono, Yie-Tarng Chen, Wen-Hsien Fang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 61-70","This paper presents a novel Hierarchical Self-Attention Network (HISAN) to generate spatial-temporal tubes for action localization in videos. The essence of HISAN is to combine the two-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) with hierarchical bidirectional self-attention mechanism, which comprises of two levels of bidirectional self-attention to efficaciously capture both of the long-term temporal dependency information and spatial context information to render more precise action localization. Also, a sequence rescoring (SR) algorithm is employed to resolve the dilemma of inconsistent detection scores incurred by occlusion or background clutter. Moreover, a new fusion scheme is invoked, which integrates not only the appearance and motion information from the two-stream network, but also the motion saliency to mitigate the effect of camera motion. Simulations reveal that the new approach achieves competitive performance as the state-of-the-art works in terms of action localization and recognition accuracy on the widespread UCF101-24 and J-HMDB datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Pramono_Hierarchical_Self-Attention_Network_for_Action_Localization_in_Videos_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv
Goal-Driven Sequential Data Abstraction,"Umar Riaz Muhammad, Yongxin Yang, Timothy M. Hospedales, Tao Xiang, Yi-Zhe Song"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 71-80","Automatic data abstraction is an important capability for both benchmarking machine intelligence and supporting summarization applications. In the former one asks whether a machine can `understand' enough about the meaning of input data to produce a meaningful but more compact abstraction. In the latter this capability is exploited for saving space or human time by summarizing the essence of input data. In this paper we study a general reinforcement learning based framework for learning to abstract sequential data in a goal-driven way. The ability to define different abstraction goals uniquely allows different aspects of the input data to be preserved according to the ultimate purpose of the abstraction. Our reinforcement learning objective does not require human-defined examples of ideal abstraction. Importantly our model processes the input sequence holistically without being constrained by the original input order. Our framework is also domain agnostic -- we demonstrate applications to sketch, video and text data and achieve promising results in all domains.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Muhammad_Goal-Driven_Sequential_Data_Abstraction_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv
Jointly Aligning Millions of Images With Deep Penalised Reconstruction Congealing,"Roberto Annunziata, Christos Sagonas, Jacques Cali"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 81-90","Extrapolating fine-grained pixel-level correspondences in a fully unsupervised manner from a large set of misaligned images can benefit several computer vision and graphics problems, e.g. co-segmentation, super-resolution, image edit propagation, structure-from-motion, and 3D reconstruction. Several joint image alignment and congealing techniques have been proposed to tackle this problem, but robustness to initialisation, ability to scale to large datasets, and alignment accuracy seem to hamper their wide applicability. To overcome these limitations, we propose an unsupervised joint alignment method leveraging a densely fused spatial transformer network to estimate the warping parameters for each image and a low-capacity auto-encoder whose reconstruction error is used as an auxiliary measure of joint alignment. Experimental results on digits from multiple versions of MNIST (i.e., original, perturbed, affNIST and infiMNIST) and faces from LFW, show that our approach is capable of aligning millions of images with high accuracy and robustness to different levels and types of perturbation. Moreover, qualitative and quantitative results suggest that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both in terms of alignment quality and robustness to initialisation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Annunziata_Jointly_Aligning_Millions_of_Images_With_Deep_Penalised_Reconstruction_Congealing_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

However, domain adversarial methods render suboptimal performances since they attempt to match the distributions among the domains without considering the task at hand. We propose Drop to Adapt (DTA), which leverages adversarial dropout to learn strongly discriminative features by enforcing the cluster assumption. Accordingly, we design objective functions to support robust domain adaptation.

NLNL: Negative Learning for Noisy Labels,"Youngdong Kim, Junho Yim, Juseung Yun, Junmo Kim"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 101-110","Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) provide excellent performance when used for image classification. The classical method of training CNNs is by labeling images in a supervised manner as in ""input image belongs to this label"" (Positive Learning; PL), which is a fast and accurate method if the labels are assigned correctly to all images. However, if inaccurate labels, or noisy labels, exist, training with PL will provide wrong information, thus severely degrading performance. To address this issue, we start with an indirect learning method called Negative Learning (NL), in which the CNNs are trained using a complementary label as in ""input image does not belong to this complementary label."" Because the chances of selecting a true label as a complementary label are low, NL decreases the risk of providing incorrect information. Furthermore, to improve convergence, we extend our method by adopting PL selectively, termed as Selective Negative Learning and Positive Learning (SelNLPL). PL is used selectively to train upon expected-to-be-clean data, whose choices become possible as NL progresses, thus resulting in superior performance of filtering out noisy data. With simple semi-supervised training technique, our method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for noisy data classification, proving the superiority of SelNLPL's noisy data filtering ability.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Kim_NLNL_Negative_Learning_for_Noisy_Labels_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

Min-max robust optimization based adversarial training can provide a notion of security against adversarial attacks. However, adversarial robustness requires a significantly larger capacity of the network than that for the natural training with only benign examples. This paper proposes a framework of concurrent adversarial training and weight pruning that enables model compression while still preserving the adversarial robustness and essentially tackles the dilemma of adversarial training. Furthermore, this work studies two hypotheses about weight pruning in the conventional setting and finds that weight pruning is essential for reducing the network model size in the adversarial setting; training a small model from scratch even with inherited initialization from the large model cannot achieve neither adversarial robustness nor high standard accuracy.

On the Design of Black-Box Adversarial Examples by Leveraging Gradient-Free Optimization and Operator Splitting Method,"Pu Zhao, Sijia Liu, Pin-Yu Chen, Nghia Hoang, Kaidi Xu, Bhavya Kailkhura, Xue Lin"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 121-130","Robust machine learning is currently one of the most prominent topics which could potentially help shaping a future of advanced AI platforms that not only perform well in average cases but also in worst cases or adverse situations. Despite the long-term vision, however, existing studies on black-box adversarial attacks are still restricted to very specific settings of threat models (e.g., single distortion metric and restrictive assumption on target model's feedback to queries) and/or suffer from prohibitively high query complexity. To push for further advances in this field, we introduce a general framework based on an operator splitting method, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to devise efficient, robust black-box attacks that work with various distortion metrics and feedback settings without incurring high query complexity. Due to the black-box nature of the threat model, the proposed ADMM solution framework is integrated with zeroth-order (ZO) optimization and Bayesian optimization (BO), and thus is applicable to the gradient-free regime. This results in two new black-box adversarial attack generation methods, ZO-ADMM and BO-ADMM.

DewarpNet: Single-Image Document Unwarping With Stacked 3D and 2D Regression Networks,"Sagnik Das, Ke Ma, Zhixin Shu, Dimitris Samaras, Roy Shilkrot"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 131-140","Capturing document images with hand-held devices in unstructured environments is a common practice nowadays. However, ""casual"" photos of documents are usually unsuitable for automatic information extraction, mainly due to physical distortion of the document paper, as well as various camera positions and illumination conditions. In this work, we propose DewarpNet, a deep-learning approach for document image unwarping from a single image. Our insight is that the 3D geometry of the document not only determines the warping of its texture but also causes the illumination effects. Therefore, our novelty resides on the explicit modeling of 3D shape for document paper in an end-to-end pipeline. Also, we contribute the largest and most comprehensive dataset for document image unwarping to date - Doc3D. This dataset features multiple ground-truth annotations, including 3D shape, surface normals, UV map, albedo image, etc. Training with Doc3D, we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for DewarpNet with extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Learning Robust Facial Landmark Detection via Hierarchical Structured Ensemble,"Xu Zou, Sheng Zhong, Luxin Yan, Xiangyun Zhao, Jiahuan Zhou, Ying Wu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 141-150","Heatmap regression-based models have significantly advanced the progress of facial landmark detection. However, the lack of structural constraints always generates inaccurate heatmaps resulting in poor landmark detection performance. While hierarchical structure modeling methods have been proposed to tackle this issue, they all heavily rely on manually designed tree structures. The designed hierarchical structure is likely to be completely corrupted due to the missing or inaccurate prediction of landmarks. To the best of our knowledge, in the context of deep learning, no work before has investigated how to automatically model proper structures for facial landmarks, by discovering their inherent relations. In this paper, we propose a novel Hierarchical Structured Landmark Ensemble (HSLE) model for learning robust facial landmark detection, by using it as the structural constraints. Different from existing approaches of manually designing structures, our proposed HSLE model is constructed automatically via discovering the most robust patterns so HSLE has the ability to robustly depict both local and holistic landmark structures simultaneously. Our proposed HSLE can be readily plugged into any existing facial landmark detection baselines for further performance improvement.

This paper proposes a method for automatically creating in-game characters of players according to an input face photo. We formulate the above ""artistic creation"" process under a facial similarity measurement and parameter searching paradigm by solving an optimization problem over a large set of physically meaningful facial parameters. To effectively minimize the distance between the created face and the real one, two loss functions, i.e. a ""discriminative loss"" and a ""facial content loss"", are specifically designed. As the rendering process of a game engine is not differentiable, a generative network is further introduced as an ""imitator"" to imitate the physical behavior of the game engine so that the proposed method can be implemented under a neural style transfer framework and the parameters can be optimized by gradient descent.

Projections arise in various contexts, such as long-exposure photography, where a dynamic scene is collapsed in time to produce a motion-blurred image, and corner cameras, where reflected light from a scene is collapsed along a spatial dimension because of an edge occluder to yield a 1D video. Deprojection is ill-posed-- often there are many plausible solutions for a given input. We first propose a probabilistic model capturing the ambiguity of the task. We then present a variational inference strategy using convolutional neural networks as functional approximators. Sampling from the inference network at test time yields plausible candidates from the distribution of original signals that are consistent with a given input projection. We evaluate the method on several datasets for both spatial and temporal deprojection tasks.

The development and proliferation of GANs raises an interesting question: can we train a GAN to remove an object, if present, from an image while otherwise preserving the image? Specifically, can a GAN ""virtually heal"" anyone by turning his medical image, with an unknown health status (diseased or healthy), into a healthy one, so that diseased regions could be revealed by subtracting those two images? Such a task requires a GAN to identify a minimal subset of target pixels for domain translation, an ability that we call fixed-point translation, which no GAN is equipped with yet. Therefore, we propose a new GAN, called Fixed-Point GAN, trained by (1) supervising same-domain translation through a conditional identity loss, and (2) regularizing cross-domain translation through revised adversarial, domain classification, and cycle consistency loss. Based on fixed-point translation, we further derive a novel framework for disease detection and localization using only image-level annotation.

We further propose a generative adversarial framework where the training of our model neither requires any pixel-wise ground truth reference nor any additional user interactions. Our model consists of three networks, a cloud generator G, a cloud discriminator D, and a cloud matting network F, where G and D aim to generate realistic and physically meaningful cloud images by adversarial training, and F learns to predict the cloud reflectance and attenuation.

Vehicle ReID is challenging due to 1) high intra-class variability (caused by the dependency of shape and appearance on viewpoint), and 2) small inter-class variability (caused by the similarity in shape and appearance between vehicles produced by different manufacturers). To address these challenges, we propose a Pose-Aware Multi-Task Re-Identification (PAMTRI) framework. This approach includes two innovations compared with previous methods. First, it overcomes viewpoint-dependency by explicitly reasoning about vehicle pose and shape via keypoints, heatmaps and segments from pose estimation. Second, it jointly classifies semantic vehicle attributes (colors and types) while performing ReID, through multi-task learning with the embedded pose representations.

HAWQ: Hessian AWare Quantization of Neural Networks With Mixed-Precision,"Zhen Dong, Zhewei Yao, Amir Gholami, Michael W. Mahoney, Kurt Keutzer"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 293-302","Model size and inference speed/power have become a major challenge in the deployment of neural networks for many applications. A promising approach to address these problems is quantization. However, uniformly quantizing a model to ultra-low precision leads to significant accuracy degradation. A novel solution for this is to use mixed-precision quantization, as some parts of the network may allow lower precision as compared to other layers. However, there is no systematic way to determine the precision of different layers. A brute force approach is not feasible for deep networks, as the search space for mixed-precision is exponential in the number of layers. Another challenge is a similar factorial complexity for determining block-wise fine-tuning order when quantizing the model to a target precision. Here, we introduce Hessian AWare Quantization (HAWQ), a novel second-order quantization method to address these problems. HAWQ allows for the automatic selection of the relative quantization precision of each layer, based on the layer's Hessian spectrum. Moreover, HAWQ provides a deterministic fine-tuning order for quantizing layers. We show the results of our method on Cifar-10 using ResNet20, and on ImageNet using Inception-V3, ResNet50 and SqueezeNext models. Comparing HAWQ with state-of-the-art shows that we can achieve similar/better accuracy with 8x activation compression ratio on ResNet20, as compared to DNAS, and up to 1% higher accuracy with up to 14% smaller models on ResNet50 and Inception-V3, compared to recently proposed methods of RVQuant and HAQ.

The outputs of multiple PoS embeddings are then used as input to an integrated multi-modal space, where we perform action retrieval. All embeddings are trained jointly through a combination of PoS-aware and PoS-agnostic losses. Our proposal enables learning specialised embedding spaces that offer multiple views of the same embedded entities. We report the first retrieval results on fine-grained actions for the large-scale EPIC dataset, in a generalised zero-shot setting. Results show the advantage of our approach for both video-to-text and text-to-video action retrieval. We also demonstrate the benefit of disentangling the PoS for the generic task of cross-modal video retrieval on the MSR-VTT dataset.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Wray_Fine-Grained_Action_Retrieval_Through_Multiple_Parts-of-Speech_Embeddings_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

A false positive (FP) from a false localization during autonomous driving can lead to fatal accidents and hinder safe and efficient driving. Therefore, a detection algorithm that can cope with mislocalizations is required in autonomous driving applications. This paper proposes a method for improving the detection accuracy while supporting a real-time operation by modeling the bounding box (bbox) of YOLOv3, which is the most representative of one-stage detectors, with a Gaussian parameter and redesigning the loss function.

First, we simplify the current fine tuning based approaches which use a combination of classification and distillation losses to compensate for the limited availability of past data. We find that the distillation term actually hurts performance when a memory is allowed. Then, we modify the usual class IL memory component. Similar to existing works, a first memory stores exemplar images of past classes. A second memory is introduced here to store past class statistics obtained when they were initially learned. The intuition here is that classes are best modeled when all their data are available and that their initial statistics are useful across different incremental states. A prediction bias towards newly learned classes appears during inference because the dataset is imbalanced in their favor. The challenge is to make predictions of new and past classes more comparable. To do this, scores of past classes are rectified by leveraging contents from both memories.

Exploiting the pixel redundancy of the background, we are able to improve the performance of Mask R-CNN for 1.7 mAP on COCO dataset and 3.3 mAP on Pascal VOC dataset by simply introducing random jittering to objects. Furthermore, we propose a location probability map based approach to explore the feasible locations that objects can be placed based on local appearance similarity. With the guidance of such map, we boost the performance of R101-Mask R-CNN on instance segmentation from 35.7 mAP to 37.9 mAP without modifying the backbone or network structure. Our method is simple to implement and does not increase the computational complexity. It can be integrated into the training pipeline of any instance segmentation model without affecting the training and inference efficiency.

However, previous methods have often propagated erroneous information due to lack of uncertainty modeling of the noisy contextual connections. In this paper, we propose the Uncertainty-Gated Graph (UGG), which conducts graph-based identity propagation between tracklets, which are represented by nodes in a graph.

Hence, these methods do not fully exploit the characteristics of the lip dynamics, causing two main drawbacks. First, the short-range temporal dependencies, which are critical to the mapping from lip images to visemes, receives no extra attention. Second, local spatial information is discarded in the existing sequence models due to the use of global average pooling (GAP). To well solve these drawbacks, we propose a Temporal Focal block to sufficiently describe short-range dependencies and a Spatio-Temporal Fusion Module (STFM) to maintain the local spatial information and to reduce the feature dimensions as well.

To address this problem, we introduce an occlusion-aware deep-learning framework. By employing estimated 2D confidence heatmaps of keypoints and an optical-flow consistency constraint, we filter out the unreliable estimations of occluded keypoints. When occlusion occurs, we have incomplete 2D keypoints and feed them to our 2D and 3D temporal convolutional networks (2D and 3D TCNs) that enforce temporal smoothness to produce a complete 3D pose. By using incomplete 2D keypoints, instead of complete but incorrect ones, our networks are less affected by the error-prone estimations of occluded keypoints. Training the occlusion-aware 3D TCN requires pairs of a 3D pose and a 2D pose with occlusion labels. As no such a dataset is available, we introduce a ""Cylinder Man Model"" to approximate the occupation of body parts in 3D space. By projecting the model onto a 2D plane in different viewing angles, we obtain and label the occluded keypoints, providing us plenty of training data.

Most previous methods use a whole face image as input for intensity prediction. Considering that AUs are defined according to their corresponding local appearance, a few patch-based methods utilize image features of local patches. However, fusion of local features is always performed via straightforward feature concatenation or summation. Besides, these methods require fully annotated databases for model learning, which is expensive to acquire. In this paper, we propose a novel weakly supervised patch-based deep model on basis of two types of attention mechanisms for joint intensity estimation of multiple AUs. The model consists of a feature fusion module and a label fusion module. And we augment attention mechanisms of these two modules with a learnable task-related context, as one patch may play different roles in analyzing different AUs and each AU has its own temporal evolution rule. The context-aware feature fusion module is used to capture spatial relationships among local patches while the context-aware label fusion module is used to capture the temporal dynamics of AUs. The latter enables the model to be trained on a partially annotated database.

The challenge for using NRSfM as teacher is that they often make poor depth reconstruction when the 2D projections have strong ambiguity. Directly using those wrong depth as hard target would negatively impact the student. Instead, we propose a novel loss that ties depth prediction to the cost function used in NRSfM. This gives the student pose estimator freedom to reduce depth error by associating with image features.

A mask dictionary is firstly established by exploiting the differences between the top conv features of occluded and occlusion-free face pairs using innovatively designed pairwise differential siamese network (PDSN). Each item of this dictionary captures the correspondence between occluded facial areas and corrupted feature elements, which is named Feature Discarding Mask (FDM).

Teacher Supervises Students How to Learn From Partially Labeled Images for Facial Landmark Detection,"Xuanyi Dong, Yi Yang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 783-792","Facial landmark detection aims to localize the anatomically defined points of human faces. In this paper, we study facial landmark detection from partially labeled facial images. A typical approach is to (1) train a detector on the labeled images; (2) generate new training samples using this detector's prediction as pseudo labels of unlabeled images; (3) retrain the detector on the labeled samples and partial pseudo labeled samples. In this way, the detector can learn from both labeled and unlabeled data and become robust. In this paper, we propose an interaction mechanism between a teacher and two students to generate more reliable pseudo labels for unlabeled data, which are beneficial to semi-supervised facial landmark detection. Specifically, the two students are instantiated as dual detectors. The teacher learns to judge the quality of the pseudo labels generated by the students and filter out unqualified samples before the retraining stage. In this way, the student detectors get feedback from their teacher and are retrained by premium data generated by itself. Since the two students are trained by different samples, a combination of their predictions will be more robust as the final prediction compared to either prediction.

TexturePose: Supervising Human Mesh Estimation With Texture Consistency,"Georgios Pavlakos, Nikos Kolotouros, Kostas Daniilidis"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 803-812","This work addresses the problem of model-based human pose estimation. Recent approaches have made significant progress towards regressing the parameters of parametric human body models directly from images. Because of the absence of images with 3D shape ground truth, relevant approaches rely on 2D annotations or sophisticated architecture designs. In this work, we advocate that there are more cues we can leverage, which are available for free in natural images, i.e., without getting more annotations, or modifying the network architecture. We propose a natural form of supervision, that capitalizes on the appearance constancy of a person among different frames (or viewpoints). This seemingly insignificant and often overlooked cue goes a long way for model-based pose estimation. The parametric model we employ allows us to compute a texture map for each frame. Assuming that the texture of the person does not change dramatically between frames, we can apply a novel texture consistency loss, which enforces that each point in the texture map has the same texture value across all frames. Since the texture is transferred in this common texture map space, no camera motion computation is necessary, or even an assumption of smoothness among frames. This makes our proposed supervision applicable in a variety of settings, ranging from monocular video, to multi-view images. We benchmark our approach against strong baselines that require the same or even more annotations that we do and we consistently outperform them. Simultaneously, we achieve state-of-the-art results among model-based pose estimation approaches in different benchmarks.

The following module explicitly constructs pair-wise relations from spatio-temporal interactions and identifies more descriptive relations that highly influence future motion of the target road user by considering its past trajectory. The resulting relational features are used to forecast future locations of the target, in the form of heatmaps with an additional guidance of spatial dependencies and consideration of the uncertainty.

Despite their complexity, these kinds of approach tend to favour short-term temporal dependencies and are thus prone to accumulating inaccuracies, which cause drift over time. Moreover, simple (static) image segmentation models, alone, can perform competitively against these methods, which further suggests that the way temporal dependencies are modelled should be reconsidered. Motivated by these observations, in this paper we explore simple yet effective strategies to model long-term temporal dependencies. Inspired by the non-local operators, we introduce a technique to establish dense correspondences between pixel embeddings of a reference ""anchor"" frame and the current one. This allows the learning of pairwise dependencies at arbitrarily long distances without conditioning on intermediate frames. Without online supervision, our approach can suppress the background and precisely segment the foreground object even in challenging scenarios, while maintaining consistent performance over time.

Although there are many types of objects in the real-word, current semantic segmentation methods make a closed world assumption and are trained only to segment a limited number of object classes. Towards a more open world approach, we propose a novel method that incrementally learns new classes for image segmentation. The proposed system first segments each RGBD frame using both color and geometric information, and then aggregates that information to build a single segmented dense 3D map of the environment. The segmented 3D map representation is a key component of our approach as it is used to discover new object classes by identifying coherent regions in the 3D map that have no semantic label. The use of coherent region in the 3D map as a primitive element, rather than traditional elements such as surfels or voxels, also significantly reduces the computational complexity and memory use of our method. It thus leads to semi-real-time performance at 10.7 Hz when incrementally updating the dense 3D map at every frame. Through experiments on the NYUDv2 dataset, we demonstrate that the proposed method is able to correctly cluster objects of both known and unseen classes.

The variable density, random orientation, small size, and instance-to-instance heterogeneity of objects in overhead imagery calls for approaches distinct from existing models designed for natural scene datasets. Though new overhead imagery datasets are being developed, they almost universally comprise a single view taken from directly overhead (""at nadir""), failing to address a critical variable: look angle. By contrast, views vary in real-world overhead imagery, particularly in dynamic scenarios such as natural disasters where first looks are often over 40 degrees off-nadir. This represents an important challenge to computer vision methods, as changing view angle adds distortions, alters resolution, and changes lighting. At present, the impact of these perturbations for algorithmic detection and segmentation of objects is untested. To address this problem, we present an open source Multi-View Overhead Imagery dataset, termed SpaceNet MVOI, with 27 unique looks from a broad range of viewing angles (-32.5 degrees to 54.0 degrees). Each of these images cover the same 665 square km geographic extent and are annotated with 126,747 building footprint labels, enabling direct assessment of the impact of viewpoint perturbation on model performance.

These issues are further exacerbated in highly congested scenes. Approaches based on straightforward fusion of multi-scale features from a deep network seem to be obvious solutions to this problem. However, these fusion approaches do not yield significant improvements in the case of crowd counting in congested scenes. This is usually due to their limited abilities in effectively combining the multi-scale features for problems like crowd counting. To overcome this, we focus on how to efficiently leverage information present in different layers of the network. Specifically, we present a network that involves: (i) a multi-level bottom-top and top-bottom fusion (MBTTBF) method to combine information from shallower to deeper layers and vice versa at multiple levels, (ii) scale complementary feature extraction blocks (SCFB) involving cross-scale residual functions to explicitly enable flow of complementary features from adjacent conv layers along the fusion paths. Furthermore, in order to increase the effectiveness of the multi-scale fusion, we employ a principled way of generating scale-aware ground-truth density maps for training.

Adaptive Density Map Generation for Crowd Counting,"Jia Wan, Antoni Chan"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 1130-1139","Crowd counting is an important topic in computer vision due to its practical usage in surveillance systems. The typical design of crowd counting algorithms is divided into two steps. First, the ground-truth density maps of crowd images are generated from the ground-truth dot maps (density map generation), e.g., by convolving with a Gaussian kernel. Second, deep learning models are designed to predict a density map from an input image (density map estimation). Most research efforts have concentrated on the density map estimation problem, while the problem of density map generation has not been adequately explored. In particular, the density map could be considered as an intermediate representation used to train a crowd counting network. In the sense of end-to-end training, the hand-crafted methods used for generating the density maps may not be optimal for the particular network or dataset used. To address this issue, we first show the impact of different density maps and that better ground-truth density maps can be obtained by refining the existing ones using a learned refinement network, which is jointly trained with the counter. Then, we propose an adaptive density map generator, which takes the annotation dot map as input, and learns a density map representation for a counter. The counter and generator are trained jointly within an end-to-end framework. The experiment results on popular counting datasets confirm the effectiveness of the proposed learnable density map representations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Wan_Adaptive_Density_Map_Generation_for_Crowd_Counting_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

Attention-Based Autism Spectrum Disorder Screening With Privileged Modality,"Shi Chen, Qi Zhao"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 1181-1190","This paper presents a novel framework for automatic and quantitative screening of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It is motivated to address two issues in the current clinical settings: 1) short of clinical resources with the prevalence of ASD (1.7% in the United States), and 2) subjectivity of ASD screening. This work differentiates itself with three unique features: first, it proposes an ASD screening with privileged modality framework that integrates information from two behavioral modalities during training and improves the performance on each single modality at testing. The proposed framework does not require overlap in subjects between the modalities. Second, it develops the first computational model to classify people with ASD using a photo-taking task where subjects freely explore their environment in a more ecological setting. Photo-taking reveals attentional preference of subjects, differentiating people with ASD from healthy people, and is also easy to implement in real-world clinical settings without requiring advanced diagnostic instruments. Third, this study for the first time takes advantage of the temporal information in eye movements while viewing images, encoding more detailed behavioral differences between ASD people and healthy controls. Experiments show that our ASD screening models can achieve superior performance, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art methods by a considerable margin. Moreover, our framework using diverse modalities demonstrates performance improvement on both the photo-taking and image-viewing tasks, providing a general paradigm that takes in multiple sources of behavioral data for a more accurate ASD screening.

Despite the great success of the generic object detection methods trained on ground-to-ground images, a huge performance drop is observed when they are directly applied to images captured by UAVs. The unsatisfactory performance is owing to many UAV-specific nuisances, such as varying flying altitudes, adverse weather conditions, dynamically changing viewing angles, etc. Those nuisances constitute a large number of fine-grained domains, across which the detection model has to stay robust. Fortunately, UAVs will record meta-data that depict those varying attributes, which are either freely available along with the UAV images, or can be easily obtained.

The most widely investigated security concern of DNN is from its malicious input, a.k.a adversarial example. Nevertheless, the security challenge of DNN's parameters is not well explored yet. In this work, we are the first to propose a novel DNN weight attack methodology called Bit-Flip Attack (BFA) which can crush a neural network through maliciously flipping extremely small amount of bits within its weight storage memory system (i.e., DRAM). The bit-flip operations could be conducted through well-known Row-Hammer attack, while our main contribution is to develop an algorithm to identify the most vulnerable bits of DNN weight parameters (stored in memory as binary bits), that could maximize the accuracy degradation with a minimum number of bit-flips. Our proposed BFA utilizes a Progressive Bit Search (PBS) method which combines gradient ranking and progressive search to identify the most vulnerable bit to be flipped. With the aid of PBS, we can successfully attack a ResNet-18 fully malfunction (i.e., top-1 accuracy degrade from 69.8% to 0.1%) only through 13 bit-flips out of 93 million bits, while randomly flipping 100 bits merely degrades the accuracy by less than 1%.

However, depth maps acquired using consumer-level sensors still suffer from non-negligible noise. This fact has recently motivated researchers to exploit traditional filters, as well as the deep learning paradigm, in order to suppress the aforementioned non-uniform noise, while preserving geometric details. Despite the effort, deep depth denoising is still an open challenge mainly due to the lack of clean data that could be used as ground truth. In this paper, we propose a fully convolutional deep autoencoder that learns to denoise depth maps, surpassing the lack of ground truth data. Specifically, the proposed autoencoder exploits multiple views of the same scene from different points of view in order to learn to suppress noise in a self-supervised end-to-end manner using depth and color information during training, yet only depth during inference. To enforce self-supervision, we leverage a differentiable rendering technique to exploit photometric supervision, which is further regularized using geometric and surface priors. As the proposed approach relies on raw data acquisition, a large RGB-D corpus is collected using Intel RealSense sensors. Complementary to a quantitative evaluation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed self-supervised denoising approach on established 3D reconstruction applications.

However, we find that the representation of a converged heavy model is still a strong constraint for training a small student model, which leads to a higher lower bound of congruence loss. In this work, we consider the knowledge distillation from the perspective of curriculum learning by teacher's routing. Instead of supervising the student model with a converged teacher model, we supervised it with some anchor points selected from the route in parameter space that the teacher model passed by, as we called route constrained optimization (RCO). We experimentally demonstrate this simple operation greatly reduces the lower bound of congruence loss for knowledge distillation, hint and mimicking learning.

In this work, we propose a new training procedure for multi-exit architectures based on the principle of knowledge distillation. The method encourages early exits to mimic later, more accurate exits, by matching their probability outputs. Experiments on CIFAR100 and ImageNet show that distillation-based training significantly improves the accuracy of early exits while maintaining state-of-the-art accuracy for late ones. The method is particularly beneficial when training data is limited and also allows a straight-forward extension to semi-supervised learning, i.e. make use also of unlabeled data at training time.

Similarity-Preserving Knowledge Distillation,"Frederick Tung, Greg Mori"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 1365-1374","Knowledge distillation is a widely applicable technique for training a student neural network under the guidance of a trained teacher network. For example, in neural network compression, a high-capacity teacher is distilled to train a compact student; in privileged learning, a teacher trained with privileged data is distilled to train a student without access to that data. The distillation loss determines how a teacher's knowledge is captured and transferred to the student. In this paper, we propose a new form of knowledge distillation loss that is inspired by the observation that semantically similar inputs tend to elicit similar activation patterns in a trained network. Similarity-preserving knowledge distillation guides the training of a student network such that input pairs that produce similar (dissimilar) activations in the teacher network produce similar (dissimilar) activations in the student network. In contrast to previous distillation methods, the student is not required to mimic the representation space of the teacher, but rather to preserve the pairwise similarities in its own representation space.

We demonstrate that progressively adapting the feature norms of the two domains to a large range of values can result in significant transfer gains, implying that those task-specific features with larger norms are more transferable.

To realize this, we propose two novel regularization strategies; a) Contour-based content regularization (CCR) and b) exploitation of inter-task coherency using a cross-task distillation module. Furthermore, avoiding a conventional ad-hoc domain discriminator, we re-utilize the cross-task distillation loss as output of an energy function to adversarially minimize the input domain discrepancy. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate superior generalizability of the learned representations simultaneously for multiple tasks under domain-shifts from synthetic to natural environments.

The simple approach of aggregating data from all source domains and training a single deep neural network end-to-end on all the data provides a surprisingly strong baseline that surpasses many prior published methods. In this paper we build on this strong baseline by designing an episodic training procedure that trains a single deep network in a way that exposes it to the domain shift that characterises a novel domain at runtime. Specifically, we decompose a deep network into feature extractor and classifier components, and then train each component by simulating it interacting with a partner who is badly tuned for the current domain. This makes both components more robust, ultimately leading to our networks producing state-of-the-art performance on three DG benchmarks. Furthermore, we consider the pervasive workflow of using an ImageNet trained CNN as a fixed feature extractor for downstream recognition tasks.

Instead of measuring the intensity of every pixel in a fixed time-interval, it reports events of significant pixel intensity changes. Every such event is represented by its position, sign of change, and timestamp, accurate to the microsecond. Asynchronous event sequences require special handling, since traditional algorithms work only with synchronous, spatially gridded data.

To prove this, we introduce ScanObjectNN, a new real-world point cloud object dataset based on scanned indoor scene data. From our comprehensive benchmark, we show that our dataset poses great challenges to existing point cloud classification techniques as objects from real-world scans are often cluttered with background and/or are partial due to occlusions. We identify three key open problems for point cloud object classification, and propose new point cloud classification neural networks that achieve state-of-the-art performance on classifying objects with cluttered background.

PointCloud Saliency Maps,"Tianhang Zheng, Changyou Chen, Junsong Yuan, Bo Li, Kui Ren"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 1598-1606","3D point-cloud recognition with PointNet and its variants has received remarkable progress. A missing ingredient, however, is the ability to automatically evaluate point-wise importance w.r.t. classification performance, which is usually reflected by a saliency map. A saliency map is an important tool as it allows one to perform further processes on point-cloud data. In this paper, we propose a novel way of characterizing critical points and segments to build point-cloud saliency maps. Our method assigns each point a score reflecting its contribution to the model-recognition loss. The saliency map explicitly explains which points are the key for model recognition. Furthermore, aggregations of highly-scored points indicate important segments/subsets in a point-cloud. Our motivation for constructing a saliency map is by point dropping, which is a non-differentiable operator. To overcome this issue, we approximate point-dropping with a differentiable procedure of shifting points towards the cloud centroid. Consequently, each saliency score can be efficiently measured by the corresponding gradient of the loss w.r.t the point under the spherical coordinates. Extensive evaluations on several state-of-the-art point-cloud recognition models, including PointNet, PointNet++ and DGCNN, demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposed saliency map.

Our simple yet effective convolution operator named ShellConv uses statistics from concentric spherical shells to define representative features and resolve the point order ambiguity, allowing traditional convolution to perform on such features. Based on ShellConv we further build an efficient neural network named ShellNet to directly consume the point clouds with larger receptive fields while maintaining less layers.

To this end, we use the functional maps framework, and build upon the recent FMNet architecture for descriptor learning. Unlike that approach, however, we show that learning can be done in a purely unsupervised setting, without having access to any ground truth correspondences. This results in a very general shape matching method that we call SURFMNet for Spectral Unsupervised FMNet, and which can be used to establish correspondences within 3D shape collections without any prior information. We demonstrate on a wide range of challenging benchmarks, that our approach leads to state-of-the-art results compared to the existing unsupervised methods and achieves results that are comparable even to the supervised learning techniques.

While quasi-lower bounds are not truly lower bounds, the Quasi-BnB algorithm is globally optimal. In fact we prove that it exhibits linear convergence -- it achieves epsilon accuracy in O(log(1/epsilon)) time while the time complexity of other rigid registration BnB algorithms is polynomial in 1/epsilon.

However, solving it exactly, i.e., finding the globally optimal solution, is intractable. A* tree search, which has been shown to be fixed-parameter tractable, is one of the most efficient exact methods, though it is still limited to small inputs. We make two key contributions towards improving A* tree search. First, we show that the consensus maximization tree structure used previously actually contains paths that connect nodes at both adjacent and non-adjacent levels. Crucially, paths connecting non-adjacent levels are redundant for tree search, but they were not avoided previously. We propose a new acceleration strategy that avoids such redundant paths. In the second contribution, we show that the existing branch pruning technique also deteriorates quickly with the problem dimension. We then propose a new branch pruning technique that is less dimension-sensitive to address this issue. Experiments show that both new techniques can significantly accelerate A* tree search, making it reasonably efficient on inputs that were previously out of reach.

The VP estimation can be reformulated as computing the rotation between the Manhattan frame and the camera frame. To compute this rotation, state-of-the-art methods are based on either data sampling or parameter search, and they fail to guarantee the accuracy and efficiency simultaneously.

This work proposes the first polynomial-time certifiably optimal approach for solving the Wahba problem when a large number of vector observations are outliers. Our first contribution is to formulate the Wahba problem using a Truncated Least Squares (TLS) cost that is insensitive to a large fraction of spurious correspondences. The second contribution is to rewrite the problem using unit quaternions and show that the TLS cost can be framed as a Quadratically-Constrained Quadratic Program (QCQP).

The convex generator generates new samples from the minority classes as convex combinations of existing instances, aiming to fool both the discriminator as well as the classifier into misclassifying the generated samples. Consequently, the artificial samples are generated at critical locations near the peripheries of the classes.

Memorizing Normality to Detect Anomaly: Memory-Augmented Deep Autoencoder for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection,"Dong Gong, Lingqiao Liu, Vuong Le, Budhaditya Saha, Moussa Reda Mansour, Svetha Venkatesh, Anton van den Hengel"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 1705-1714","Deep autoencoder has been extensively used for anomaly detection. Training on the normal data, the autoencoder is expected to produce higher reconstruction error for the abnormal inputs than the normal ones, which is adopted as a criterion for identifying anomalies. However, this assumption does not always hold in practice. It has been observed that sometimes the autoencoder ""generalizes"" so well that it can also reconstruct anomalies well, leading to the miss detection of anomalies. To mitigate this drawback for autoencoder based anomaly detector, we propose to augment the autoencoder with a memory module and develop an improved autoencoder called memory-augmented autoencoder, i.e. MemAE. Given an input, MemAE firstly obtains the encoding from the encoder and then uses it as a query to retrieve the most relevant memory items for reconstruction. At the training stage, the memory contents are updated and are encouraged to represent the prototypical elements of the normal data. At the test stage, the learned memory will be fixed, and the reconstruction is obtained from a few selected memory records of the normal data. The reconstruction will thus tend to be close to a normal sample. Thus the reconstructed errors on anomalies will be strengthened for anomaly detection. MemAE is free of assumptions on the data type and thus general to be applied to different tasks.

Specifically, we take the advantage of convolutional long short-term memory (CLSTM) and propose a novel spatial-temporal CSLTM (ST-CLSTM) structure.

Existing models often generate a complete sentence from the first word to the end, without considering the influence of the following words on the whole sentence generation. In this paper, we explore the utilization of a human-like cognitive style, i.e., building overall cognition for the image to be described and the sentence to be constructed, for enhancing computer image understanding. This paper first proposes a Mutual-aid network structure with Bidirectional LSTMs (MaBi-LSTMs) for acquiring overall contextual information. In the training process, the forward and backward LSTMs encode the succeeding and preceding words into their respective hidden states by simultaneously constructing the whole sentence in a complementary manner. In the captioning process, the LSTM implicitly utilizes the subsequent semantic information contained in its hidden states. In fact, MaBi-LSTMs can generate two sentences in forward and backward directions. To bridge the gap between cross-domain models and generate a sentence with higher quality, we further develop a cross-modal attention mechanism to retouch the two sentences by fusing their salient parts as well as the salient areas of the image.

Unlike most of the other neural architecture searching (NAS) technologies, we consider the searching space in a fundamental scope: kernel space, which encodes the assembly of basic multiply-accumulate (MAC) operations into a conv-kernel. We first deduce a strict form of the generalized convolutional operator by some necessary constraints and construct a continuous searching space for its extra freedom-of-degree, namely, the connection of each MAC. Then a novel unsupervised greedy evolution algorithm called gradient agreement guided searching (GAGS) is proposed to learn the optimal location for each MAC in the spatially continuous searching space. We leverage DKE on multiple kinds of tasks such as object classification, face/object detection, large-scale fine-grained and recognition, with various kinds of backbone architecture. Not to mention the consistent performance gain, we found the proposed DKE can further act as an auto-dilated operator, which makes it easy to boost the performance of miniaturized neural networks in multiple tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Liu_Differentiable_Kernel_Evolution_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv
Batch Weight for Domain Adaptation With Mass Shift,"Mikolaj Binkowski, Devon Hjelm, Aaron Courville"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 1844-1853","Unsupervised domain transfer is the task of transferring or translating samples from a source distribution to a different target distribution. Current solutions unsupervised domain transfer often operate on data on which the modes of the distribution are well-matched, for instance have the same frequencies of classes between source and target distributions. However, these models do not perform well when the modes are not well-matched, as would be the case when samples are drawn independently from two different, but related, domains. This mode imbalance is problematic as generative adversarial networks (GANs), a successful approach in this setting, are sensitive to mode frequency, which results in a mismatch of semantics between source samples and generated samples of the target distribution. We propose a principled method of re-weighting training samples to correct for such mass shift between the transferred distributions, which we call batch weight. We also provide rigorous probabilistic setting for domain transfer and new simplified objective for training transfer networks, an alternative to complex, multi-component loss functions used in the current state-of-the art image-to-image translation models. The new objective stems from the discrimination of joint distributions and enforces cycle-consistency in an abstract, high-level, rather than pixel-wise, sense.

In the latter case, the optimization is often non-differentiable and also not very amenable to derivative-free optimization methods. Most methods in use today require sizable computational resources. And if we want networks that additionally satisfy resource constraints, the above challenges are exacerbated because the search must now balance accuracy with certain budget constraints on resources. We formulate this problem as the optimization of a set function -- we find that the empirical behavior of this set function often (but not always) satisfies marginal gain and monotonicity principles -- properties central to the idea of submodularity. Based on this observation, we adapt algorithms within discrete optimization to obtain heuristic schemes for neural network architecture search, where we have resource constraints on the architecture. This simple scheme when applied on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, identifies resource-constrained architectures with quantifiably better performance than current state-of-the-art models designed for mobile devices.

Generally, most existing single-stage detectors follow two common practices: they employ a network backbone that is pretrained on ImageNet for the classification task and use a top-down feature pyramid representation for handling scale variations. Contrary to common pre-training strategy, recent works have demonstrated the benefits of training from scratch to reduce the task gap between classification and localization, especially at high overlap thresholds. However, detection models trained from scratch require significantly longer training time compared to their typical finetuning based counterparts. We introduce a single-stage detection framework that combines the advantages of both fine-tuning pretrained models and training from scratch. Our framework constitutes a standard network that uses a pre-trained backbone and a parallel light-weight auxiliary network trained from scratch. Further, we argue that the commonly used top-down pyramid representation only focuses on passing high-level semantics from the top layers to bottom layers.

To address this problem, we develop a new model called Embodied Mask R-CNN for agents to learn to move strategically to improve their visual recognition abilities.

Two students that appear close to each other in the image may not in fact be ""next to"" each other if there is a third student between them. We introduce SpatialSense, a dataset specializing in spatial relation recognition which captures a broad spectrum of such challenges, allowing for proper benchmarking of computer vision techniques. SpatialSense is constructed through adversarial crowdsourcing, in which human annotators are tasked with finding spatial relations that are difficult to predict using simple cues such as 2D spatial configuration or language priors. Adversarial crowdsourcing significantly reduces dataset bias and samples more interesting relations in the long tail compared to existing datasets. On SpatialSense, state-of-the-art recognition models perform comparably to simple baselines, suggesting that they rely on straightforward cues instead of fully reasoning about this complex task.

In this work, we investigate the paradigm of dense sliding-window instance segmentation, which is surprisingly under-explored. Our core observation is that this task is fundamentally different than other dense prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation or bounding-box object detection, as the output at every spatial location is itself a geometric structure with its own spatial dimensions. To formalize this, we treat dense instance segmentation as a prediction task over 4D tensors and present a general framework called TensorMask that explicitly captures this geometry and enables novel operators on 4D tensors. We demonstrate that the tensor view leads to large gains over baselines that ignore this structure, and leads to results comparable to Mask R-CNN. These promising results suggest that TensorMask can serve as a foundation for novel advances in dense mask prediction and a more complete understanding of the task.

However, normal image classifiers produce attention only at the most discriminative object parts, which limits the performance of weakly-supervised segmentation task. Therefore, how to effectively identify entire object regions in a weakly-supervised manner has always been a challenging and meaningful problem. We observe that the attention maps produced by a classification network continuously focus on different object parts during training. In order to accumulate the discovered different object parts, we propose an online attention accumulation (OAA) strategy which maintains a cumulative attention map for each target category in each training image so that the integral object regions can be gradually promoted as the training goes. These cumulative attention maps, in turn, serve as the pixel-level supervision, which can further assist the network in discovering more integral object regions. Our method (OAA) can be plugged into any classification network and progressively accumulate the discriminative regions into integral objects as the training process goes. Despite its simplicity, when applying the resulting attention maps to the weakly-supervised semantic segmentation task, our approach improves the existing state-of-the-art methods on the PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation benchmark, achieving a mIoU score of 66.4% on the test set.

Recently, some semi-supervised learning methods have been applied to UDA and achieved state-of-the-art performance. One of the most popular approaches in semi-supervised learning is the entropy minimization method.

Having observed that, in both cases, the detected regions typically do not correspond to unexpected objects, in this paper, we introduce a drastically different strategy: It relies on the intuition that the network will produce spurious labels in regions depicting unexpected objects. Therefore, resynthesizing the image from the resulting semantic map will yield significant appearance differences with respect to the input image.

As one prominent example, depth discontinuities around thin structures are often incorrectly estimated by current state-of-the-art methods.

In this work we take four previously published networks and investigate what depth cues they exploit. We find that all networks ignore the apparent size of known obstacles in favor of their vertical position in the image. The use of the vertical position requires the camera pose to be known; however, we find that these networks only partially recognize changes in camera pitch and roll angles.

Black, Kostas Daniilidis"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 2252-2261","Model-based human pose estimation is currently approached through two different paradigms. Optimization-based methods fit a parametric body model to 2D observations in an iterative manner, leading to accurate image-model alignments, but are often slow and sensitive to the initialization. In contrast, regression-based methods, that use a deep network to directly estimate the model parameters from pixels, tend to provide reasonable, but not pixel accurate, results while requiring huge amounts of supervision. In this work, instead of investigating which approach is better, our key insight is that the two paradigms can form a strong collaboration. A reasonable, directly regressed estimate from the network can initialize the iterative optimization making the fitting faster and more accurate. Similarly, a pixel accurate fit from iterative optimization can act as strong supervision for the network. This is the core of our proposed approach SPIN (SMPL oPtimization IN the loop). The deep network initializes an iterative optimization routine that fits the body model to 2D joints within the training loop, and the fitted estimate is subsequently used to supervise the network. Our approach is self-improving by nature, since better network estimates can lead the optimization to better solutions, while more accurate optimization fits provide better supervision for the network.

Black"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 2282-2292","To understand and analyze human behavior, we need to capture humans moving in, and interacting with, the world. Most existing methods perform 3D human pose estimation without explicitly considering the scene. We observe however that the world constrains the body and vice-versa. To motivate this, we show that current 3D human pose estimation methods produce results that are not consistent with the 3D scene. Our key contribution is to exploit static 3D scene structure to better estimate human pose from monocular images. The method enforces Proximal Relationships with Object eXclusion and is called PROX. To test this, we collect a new dataset composed of 12 different 3D scenes and RGB sequences of 20 subjects moving in and interacting with the scenes. We represent human pose using the 3D human body model SMPL-X and extend SMPLify-X to estimate body pose using scene constraints. We make use of the 3D scene information by formulating two main constraints. The inter-penetration constraint penalizes intersection between the body model and the surrounding 3D scene. The contact constraint encourages specific parts of the body to be in contact with scene surfaces if they are close enough in distance and orientation. For quantitative evaluation we capture a separate dataset with 180 RGB frames in which the ground-truth body pose is estimated using a motion capture system. We show quantitatively that introducing scene constraints significantly reduces 3D joint error and vertex error.

This paper proposes a deep Dense-Fine-Finer Network (DF2Net) to address this challenging problem.

D-Net exploits a U-net architecture to map the input image to a dense depth image. F-Net refines the output of D-Net by integrating features from depth and RGB domains, whose output is further enhanced by Fr-Net with a novel multi-resolution hypercolumn architecture.

To overcome the limitation of separate optical flow estimation, we propose a Spatio-Temporal Filter Adaptive Network (STFAN) for the alignment and deblurring in a unified framework. The proposed STFAN takes both blurry and restored images of the previous frame as well as blurry image of the current frame as input, and dynamically generates the spatially adaptive filters for the alignment and deblurring.

We solve the variational model based on the classical gradient descent method with built-in deep CNNs so that iteration-wise image priors for the atmospheric light, transmission map and clear image can be well estimated.

SGN directly generates multi-resolution inputs with the shuffling operation. Large-scale contextual information extracted at low resolution is gradually propagated into the higher resolution sub-networks to guide the feature extraction processes at these scales. Such a self-guidance strategy enables SGN to efficiently incorporate multi-scale information and extract good local features to recover noisy images.

With this observation, we formulate intrinsic decomposition as an energy minimisation problem. Unlike existing methods, our energy formulation decouples reflectance and shading estimation, into a convex local shading component based on NIR-RGB image pair, and a reflectance component that encourages reflectance homogeneity both locally and globally.

Given a triplet: an image, Q&A history, and current question, all the prevailing methods follow a codec (i.e., encoder-decoder) fashion in a supervised learning paradigm: a multimodal encoder encodes the triplet into a feature vector, which is then fed into the decoder for the current answer generation, supervised by the ground-truth. However, this conventional supervised learning does NOT take into account the impact of imperfect history, violating the conversational nature of visual dialog and thus making the codec more inclined to learn history bias but not contextual reasoning. To this end, inspired by the actor-critic policy gradient in reinforcement learning, we propose a novel training paradigm called History Advantage Sequence Training (HAST). Specifically, we intentionally impose wrong answers in the history, obtaining an adverse critic, and see how the historic error impacts the codec's future behavior by History Advantage -- a quantity obtained by subtracting the adverse critic from the gold reward of ground-truth history.

We propose a novel representation learning method having higher location-discriminating power. It provides the following contributions: 1) we represent a place (location) as a set of exemplar images depicting the same landmarks and aim to maximize similarities among intra-place images while minimizing similarities among inter-place images; 2) we model a similarity measure as a probability distribution on L_2-metric distances between intra-place and inter-place image representations; 3) we propose a new Stochastic Attraction and Repulsion Embedding (SARE) loss function minimizing the KL divergence between the learned and the actual probability distributions; 4) we give theoretical comparisons between SARE, triplet ranking and contrastive losses.

Nevertheless, there has not been evidence in support of the idea on describing an image with a natural-language utterance. In this paper, we introduce a new design to model a hierarchy from instance level (segmentation), region level (detection) to the whole image to delve into a thorough image understanding for captioning. Specifically, we present a HIerarchy Parsing (HIP) architecture that novelly integrates hierarchical structure into image encoder. Technically, an image decomposes into a set of regions and some of the regions are resolved into finer ones. Each region then regresses to an instance, i.e., foreground of the region. Such process naturally builds a hierarchal tree. A tree-structured Long Short-Term Memory (Tree-LSTM) network is then employed to interpret the hierarchal structure and enhance all the instance-level, region-level and image-level features. Our HIP is appealing in view that it is pluggable to any neural captioning models. Extensive experiments on COCO image captioning dataset demonstrate the superiority of HIP. More remarkably, HIP plus a top-down attention-based LSTM decoder increases CIDEr-D performance from 120.1% to 127.2% on COCO Karpathy test split.

The polarization constraints allow us to pointwise recover the 3D surface normal up to a two-fold ambiguity for the diffuse reflection. Since this ambiguity exists per point, there is a combinatorial explosion of possibilities. However, since our solver only requires two point correspondences, we only need to consider 16 configurations when solving for the relative pose. Once the relative orientation is recovered, we show that it is trivial to resolve the ambiguity for the remaining points. For robustness, we also propose a joint optimization between the relative pose and the refractive index to handle the refractive distortion.

Several mainstream works (e.g., 3D-R2N2) use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to fuse multiple feature maps extracted from input images sequentially. However, when given the same set of input images with different orders, RNN-based approaches are unable to produce consistent reconstruction results. Moreover, due to long-term memory loss, RNNs cannot fully exploit input images to refine reconstruction results. To solve these problems, we propose a novel framework for single-view and multi-view 3D reconstruction, named Pix2Vox. By using a well-designed encoder-decoder, it generates a coarse 3D volume from each input image. Then, a context-aware fusion module is introduced to adaptively select high-quality reconstructions for each part (e.g., table legs) from different coarse 3D volumes to obtain a fused 3D volume. Finally, a refiner further refines the fused 3D volume to generate the final output. Experimental results on the ShapeNet and Pix3D benchmarks indicate that the proposed Pix2Vox outperforms state-of-the-arts by a large margin.

Unsupervised Robust Disentangling of Latent Characteristics for Image Synthesis,"Patrick Esser, Johannes Haux, Bjorn Ommer"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 2699-2709","Deep generative models come with the promise to learn an explainable representation for visual objects that allows image sampling, synthesis, and selective modification. The main challenge is to learn to properly model the independent latent characteristics of an object, especially its appearance and pose. We present a novel approach that learns disentangled representations of these characteristics and explains them individually. Training requires only pairs of images depicting the same object appearance, but no pose annotations. We propose an additional classifier that estimates the minimal amount of regularization required to enforce disentanglement.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to benefit from perceptual loss in a more objective way. We optimize a deep network-based decoder with a targeted objective function that penalizes images at different semantic levels using the corresponding terms.

Recently, generation-based methods have received much attention since they directly use feed-forward networks to generate the adversarial samples, which avoid the time-consuming iterative attacking procedure in optimization-based and gradient-based methods. However, current generation-based methods are only able to attack one specific target (category) within one model, thus making them not applicable to real classification systems that often have hundreds/thousands of categories. In this paper, we propose the first Multi-target Adversarial Network (MAN), which can generate multi-target adversarial samples with a single model. By incorporating the specified category information into the intermediate features, it can attack any category of the target classification model during runtime. Experiments show that the proposed MAN can produce stronger attack results and also have better transferability than previous state-of-the-art methods in both multi-target attack task and single-target attack task. We further use the adversarial samples generated by our MAN to improve the robustness of the classification model. It can also achieve better classification accuracy than other methods when attacked by various methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Han_Once_a_MAN_Towards_Multi-Target_Attack_via_Learning_Multi-Target_Adversarial_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

In this paper, we use knowledge from the source domain to guide the network's response to categories shared with the target domain. With weights sharing and domain adversary training, this knowledge can be successfully transferred by regularizing the network's response to the same category in the target domain.

Our key observation is that the disentangled latent variables responsible for major sources of variability, the relevant factors, can be more appropriately modeled using long-tail distributions. The typical Gaussian priors are, on the other hand, better suited for modeling of nuisance factors. Motivated by this, we extend the VAE to a hierarchical Bayesian model by introducing hyper-priors on the variances of Gaussian latent priors, mimicking an infinite mixture, while maintaining tractable learning and inference of the traditional VAEs.

The losses of each sample are recorded during iterations. The higher the normalized average loss of a sample, the higher the probability of being noisy labels. O2U-net is naturally compatible with active learning and other human annotation approaches. This introduces extra flexibility for learning with noisy labels. We conduct sufficient experiments on multiple datasets in various settings.

Although continual learning has been investigated as a countermeasure to the problem, it often suffers from the requirements of additional network components and the limited scalability to a large number of tasks. We propose a novel approach to continual learning by approximating a true loss function using an asymmetric quadratic function with one of its sides overestimated. Our algorithm is motivated by the empirical observation that the network parameter updates affect the target loss functions asymmetrically. In the proposed continual learning framework, we estimate an asymmetric loss function for the tasks considered in the past through a proper overestimation of its unobserved sides in training new tasks, while deriving the accurate model parameter for the observable sides. In contrast to existing approaches, our method is free from the side effects and achieves the state-of-the-art accuracy that is even close to the upper-bound performance on several challenging benchmark datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Park_Continual_Learning_by_Asymmetric_Loss_Approximation_With_Single-Side_Overestimation_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

However, for discriminative tasks, there is a possibility that these layers lose the discriminative details due to improper pooling strategies, which could hinder the learning process and eventually result in suboptimal models. In this paper, we present a unified framework over the existing downsampling layers (e.g., average pooling, max pooling, and strided convolution) from a local importance view. In this framework, we analyze the issues of these widely-used pooling layers and figure out the criteria for designing an effective downsampling layer. According to this analysis, we propose a conceptually simple, general, and effective pooling layer based on local importance modeling, termed as Local Importance-based Pooling (LIP). LIP can automatically enhance discriminative features during the downsampling procedure by learning adaptive importance weights based on inputs. Experiment results show that LIP consistently yields notable gains with different depths and different architectures on ImageNet classification.

There are several types of pooling operation, such as average/max-pooling, from which one has to be manually selected for building CNNs. The optimal pooling type would be dependent on characteristics of features in CNNs and classification tasks, making it hard to find out the proper pooling module in advance. In this paper, we propose a flexible pooling method which adaptively tunes the pooling functionality based on input features without manually fixing it beforehand. In the proposed method, the parameterized pooling form is derived from a probabilistic perspective to flexibly represent various types of pooling and then the parameters are estimated by means of global statistics in the input feature map.

Domain adaptation techniques solve this problem by training transferable models from the label-rich source domain to the label-scarce target domain. Unfortunately, a majority of the existing domain adaptation techniques rely on the availability of the target-domain data, and thus limit their applications to a small community across few computer vision problems. In this paper, we tackle the challenging zero-shot domain adaptation (ZSDA) problem, where the target-domain data is non-available in the training stage. For this purpose, we propose conditional coupled generative adversarial networks (CoCoGAN) by extending the coupled generative adversarial networks (CoGAN) into a conditioning model. Compared with the existing state of the arts, our proposed CoCoGAN is able to capture the joint distribution of dual-domain samples in two different tasks, i.e. the relevant task (RT) and an irrelevant task (IRT). We train the CoCoGAN with both source-domain samples in RT and the dual-domain samples in IRT to complete the domain adaptation. While the former provide the high-level concepts of the non-available target-domain data, the latter carry the sharing correlation between the two domains in RT and IRT. To train the CoCoGAN in the absence of the target-domain data for RT, we propose a new supervisory signal, i.e. the alignment between representations across tasks.

The robustness of existing defenses suffers greatly under white-box attack settings, where an adversary has full knowledge about the network and can iterate several times to find strong perturbations. We observe that the main reason for the existence of such perturbations is the close proximity of different class samples in the learned feature space. This allows model decisions to be totally changed by adding an imperceptible perturbation in the inputs. To counter this, we propose to class-wise disentangle the intermediate feature representations of deep networks. Specifically, we force the features for each class to lie inside a convex polytope that is maximally separated from the polytopes of other classes. In this manner, the network is forced to learn distinct and distant decision regions for each class. We observe that this simple constraint on the features greatly enhances the robustness of learned models, even against the strongest white-box attacks, without degrading the classification performance on clean images.

Instead of reasoning about every frame separately, our method selects and only processes a small sub-window of the frame. Our technique then makes predictions for the full frame based on the sub-windows from previous frames and the update from the current sub-window. The latency reduction by this hard attention mechanism comes at the cost of degraded accuracy. We made two contributions to address this. First, we propose a specialized memory cell that recovers lost context when processing sub-windows. Secondly, we adopt a Q-learning-based policy training strategy that enables our approach to intelligently select the sub-windows such that the staleness in the memory hurts the performance the least. Our experiments suggest that our approach reduces the latency by approximately four times without significantly sacrificing the accuracy on the ImageNet VID video object detection dataset and the DAVIS video object segmentation dataset.

To address these problems, this paper proposes a Dynamic Multi-scale Network (DMNet) to adaptively capture multi-scale contents for predicting pixel-level semantic labels.

However, most cameras observe only a very small fraction of this distribution. This offers the possibility of achieving more efficient inference by specializing compact, low-cost models to the specific distribution of frames observed by a single camera. In this paper, we employ the technique of model distillation (supervising a low-cost student model using the output of a high-cost teacher) to specialize accurate, low-cost semantic segmentation models to a target video stream. Rather than learn a specialized student model on offline data from the video stream, we train the student in an online fashion on the live video, intermittently running the teacher to provide a target for learning. Online model distillation yields semantic segmentation models that closely approximate their Mask R-CNN teacher with 7 to 17xlower inference runtime cost (11 to 26xin FLOPs), even when the target video's distribution is non-stationary. Our method requires no offline pretraining on the target video stream, achieves higher accuracy and lower cost than solutions based on flow or video object segmentation, and can exhibit better temporal stability than the original teacher.

We instead reformulate ZSL as a conditioned visual classification problem, i.e., classifying visual features based on the classifiers learned from the semantic descriptions. With this reformulation, we develop algorithms targeting various ZSL settings: For the conventional setting, we propose to train a deep neural network that directly generates visual feature classifiers from the semantic attributes with an episode-based training scheme; For the generalized setting, we concatenate the learned highly discriminative classifiers for seen classes and the generated classifiers for unseen classes to classify visual features of all classes; For the transductive setting, we exploit unlabeled data to effectively calibrate the classifier generator using a novel learning-without-forgetting self-training mechanism and guide the process by a robust generalized cross-entropy loss.

In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods require hundreds of training examples for each possible category to build reliable and accurate classifiers. To alleviate this striking difference in efficiency, we propose a task-driven modular architecture for compositional reasoning and sample efficient learning. Our architecture consists of a set of neural network modules, which are small fully connected layers operating in semantic concept space. These modules are configured through a gating function conditioned on the task to produce features representing the compatibility between the input image and the concept under consideration. This enables us to express tasks as a combination of sub-tasks and to generalize to unseen categories by reweighting a set of small modules. Furthermore, the network can be trained efficiently as it is fully differentiable and its modules operate on small sub-spaces. We focus our study on the problem of compositional zero-shot classification of object-attribute categories. We show in our experiments that current evaluation metrics are flawed as they only consider unseen object-attribute pairs.

Specifically, a multi-branch network architecture is devised, in which cascaded global contexts are learned by introducing similarity constraint at each branch, and leveraged as guidance of spatial feature encoding at next branch through an attribute transfer scheme. To enhance the modeling capability of spatial transformation, a deformable pooling strategy is introduced to augment the spatial sampling with adaptive offsets to the global context, leading to perceive new visual attributes. An attribute fusion module is then introduced to jointly utilize the perceived visual attributes and the abstracted semantic concepts at each branch.

However, computing exact GCVTs is slow due to computationally expensive geodesic distances. In this paper, we propose a much faster queue-based graph distance (called q-distance). Our key idea is that for manifold regions in which q-distances are different from geodesic distances, GCVT is prone to placing more generators in them, and therefore after few iterations, the q-distance-induced tessellation is an exact GCVT. This idea works well in practice and we also prove it theoretically under moderate assumption. Our method is simple and easy to implement. It runs 6-8 times faster than state-of-the-art GCVT computation, and has an optimal approximation ratio O(1) and a linear time complexity O(N) for N-pixel images or N-voxel videos.

To address this selectivity-invariance dilemma, we propose a novel boundary-aware network with successive dilation for image-based SOD.

Spatial-Temporal Relation Networks for Multi-Object Tracking,"Jiarui Xu, Yue Cao, Zheng Zhang, Han Hu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 3988-3998","Recent progress in multiple object tracking (MOT) has shown that a robust similarity score is a key to the success of trackers. A good similarity score is expected to reflect multiple cues, e.g. appearance, location, and topology, over a long period of time. However, these cues are heterogeneous, making them hard to be combined in a unified network. As a result, existing methods usually encode them in separate networks or require a complex training approach. In this paper, we present a unified framework for similarity measurement based on spatial-temporal relation network which could simultaneously encode various cues and perform reasoning across both spatial and temporal domains. We also study the feature representation of a tracklet-object pair in depth, showing a proper design of the pair features can well empower the trackers. The resulting approach is named spatial-temporal relation networks (STRN). It runs in a feed-forward way and can be trained in an end-to-end manner.

Bridging the Gap Between Detection and Tracking: A Unified Approach,"Lianghua Huang, Xin Zhao, Kaiqi Huang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 3999-4009","Object detection models have been a source of inspiration for many tracking-by-detection algorithms over the past decade. Recent deep trackers borrow designs or modules from the latest object detection methods, such as bounding box regression, RPN and ROI pooling, and can deliver impressive performance. In this paper, instead of redesigning a new tracking-by-detection algorithm, we aim to explore a general framework for building trackers directly upon almost any advanced object detector. To achieve this, three key gaps must be bridged: (1) Object detectors are class-specific, while trackers are class-agnostic. (2) Object detectors do not differentiate intra-class instances, while this is a critical capability of a tracker. (3) Temporal cues are important for stable long-term tracking while they are not considered in still-image detectors. To address the above issues, we first present a simple target-guidance module for guiding the detector to locate target-relevant objects. Then a meta-learner is adopted for the detector to fast learn and adapt a target-distractor classifier online. We further introduce an anchored updating strategy to alleviate the problem of overfitting. The framework is instantiated on SSD and FasterRCNN, the typical one- and two-stage detectors, respectively. Experiments on OTB, UAV123 and NfS have verified our framework and show that our trackers can benefit from deeper backbone networks, as opposed to many recent trackers.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Huang_Bridging_the_Gap_Between_Detection_and_Tracking_A_Unified_Approach_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

In general, this template is linearly combined with the accumulated template from the previous frame, resulting in an exponential decay of information over time. While such an approach to updating has led to improved results, its simplicity limits the potential gain likely to be obtained by learning to update. Therefore, we propose to replace the handcrafted update function with a method which learns to update. We use a convolutional neural network, called UpdateNet, which given the initial template, the accumulated template and the template of the current frame aims to estimate the optimal template for the next frame. The UpdateNet is compact and can easily be integrated into existing Siamese trackers. We demonstrate the generality of the proposed approach by applying it to two Siamese trackers, SiamFC and DaSiamRPN. Extensive experiments on VOT2016, VOT2018, LaSOT, and TrackingNet datasets demonstrate that our UpdateNet effectively predicts the new target template, outperforming the standard linear update.

In order to achieve real-time tracking speed while maintaining high localization accuracy, in this paper, we propose a novel CF tracker, fdKCF*, which casts aside the popular acceleration tool, i.e., fast Fourier transform, employed by all existing CF trackers, and exploits the inherent high-overlap among real (i.e., noncyclic) and dense samples to efficiently construct the kernel matrix. Our fdKCF* enjoys the following three advantages. (i) It is efficiently trained in kernel space and spatial domain without the boundary effect. (ii) Its fps is almost independent of the number of feature channels. Therefore, it is almost real-time, i.e., 24 fps on OTB-2015, even though the high-dimensional deep features are employed.

This paper proposes a new calibration method for large field of view cameras. Similarly to planar calibration, it relies on multiple images of a planar calibration grid with dense correspondences, typically obtained using structured light. By relying on the grids themselves instead of the distorted image plane, we can build a rectilinear Generic Virtual Central (GVC) camera. Instead of relying on a single GVC camera, our method proposes a selection of multiple GVC cameras which can cover any field of view and be trivially aligned to provide a very accurate generic central model. We demonstrate that this approach can directly model axial cameras, assuming the distortion center is located on the camera axis.

First, we propose supervised focus from segmentation, where points are converted into binary maps. The binary maps are combined with a network branch and accompanying loss function to focus on areas of interest. Second, we propose supervised focus from global density, where the ratio of point annotations to image pixels is used in another branch to regularize the overall density estimation.

Much prior work uses either a supervised mode of learning or stereo images. The former is limited by the amount of labeled data, as it requires expensive sensors, while the latter is not always readily available as monocular sequences. In this work, we demonstrate the benefit of using geometric information from synthetic images, coupled with scene depth information, to recover the scale in depth and ego-motion estimation from monocular videos. We developed our framework using synthetic image-depth pairs and unlabeled real monocular images. We had three training objectives: first, to use deep feature alignment to reduce the domain gap between synthetic and monocular images to yield more accurate depth estimation when presented with only real monocular images at test time. Second, we learn scene specific representation by exploiting self-supervision coming from multi-view synthetic images without the need for depth labels. Third, our method uses single-view depth and pose networks, which are capable of jointly training and supervising one another mutually, yielding consistent depth and ego-motion estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our depth and ego-motion models surpass the state-of-the-art, unsupervised methods and compare favorably to early supervised deep models for geometric understanding.

However, the improvement by directly fusing shallow features and deep features becomes limited as the semantic gap between them increases. To solve this problem, we explore two strategies for robust feature fusion. One is enhancing shallow features using a semantic enhancement module (SeEM) to alleviate the semantic gap between shallow features and deep features. The other strategy is feature attention, which involves discovering complementary information (i.e., boundary information) from low-level features to enhance high-level features for precise segmentation. By embedding these two strategies, we construct a parallel feature pyramid towards improving multi-level feature fusion. A Semantic Enhanced Network called SeENet is constructed with the parallel pyramid to implement precise segmentation.

To render existing encoder-decoder image captioners such human-like reasoning, we propose a novel framework: learning to Collocate Neural Modules (CNM), to generate the ""inner pattern"" connecting visual encoder and language decoder. Unlike the widely-used neural module networks in visual Q&A, where the language (i.e., question) is fully observable, CNM for captioning is more challenging as the language is being generated and thus is partially observable. To this end, we make the following technical contributions for CNM training: 1) compact module design --- one for function words and three for visual content words (e.g., noun, adjective, and verb), 2) soft module fusion and multi-step module execution, robustifying the visual reasoning in partial observation, 3) a linguistic loss for module controller being faithful to part-of-speech collocations (e.g., adjective is before noun). Extensive experiments on the challenging MS-COCO image captioning benchmark validate the effectiveness of our CNM image captioner. In particular, CNM achieves a new state-of-the-art 127.9 CIDEr-D on Karpathy split and a single-model 126.0 c40 on the official server.

However, they are hard to handle for machine learning algorithms due to the unordered structure. One common approach is to apply voxelization, which dramatically increases the amount of data stored and at the same time loses details through discretization. Recently, deep learning models with hand-tailored architectures were proposed to handle point clouds directly and achieve input permutation invariance. However, these architectures use an increased number of parameters and are computationally inefficient. In this work we propose basis point sets as a highly efficient and fully general way to process point clouds with machine learning algorithms. Basis point sets are a residual representation that can be computed efficiently and can be used with standard neural network architectures. Using the proposed representation as the input to a relatively simple network allows us to match the performance of PointNet on a shape classification task while using three order of magnitudes less floating point operations. In a second experiment, we show how proposed representation can be used for obtaining high resolution meshes from noisy 3D scans.

Finally, the target object is segmented in the query image by using a cosine similarity between the class feature vector and the query's feature map. We make two contributions by: (1) Improving discriminativeness of features so their activations are high on the foreground and low elsewhere; and (2) Boosting inference with an ensemble of experts guided with the gradient of loss incurred when segmenting the support images in testing.

Visual Semantic Reasoning for Image-Text Matching,"Kunpeng Li, Yulun Zhang, Kai Li, Yuanyuan Li, Yun Fu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 4654-4662","Image-text matching has been a hot research topic bridging the vision and language areas. It remains challenging because the current representation of image usually lacks global semantic concepts as in its corresponding text caption. To address this issue, we propose a simple and interpretable reasoning model to generate visual representation that captures key objects and semantic concepts of a scene. Specifically, we first build up connections between image regions and perform reasoning with Graph Convolutional Networks to generate features with semantic relationships. Then, we propose to use the gate and memory mechanism to perform global semantic reasoning on these relationship-enhanced features, select the discriminative information and gradually generate the representation for the whole scene. Experiments validate that our method achieves a new state-of-the-art for the image-text matching on MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets. It outperforms the current best method by 6.8% relatively for image retrieval and 4.8% relatively for caption retrieval on MS-COCO (Recall@1 using 1K test set).

Existing work attempts to learn these mappings from examples of phrase-image region correspondences (strong supervision) or from phrase-image pairs (weak supervision). We postulate that such paired annotations are unnecessary, and propose the first method for the phrase localization problem where neither training procedure nor paired, task-specific data is required. Our method is simple but effective: we use off-the-shelf approaches to detect objects, scenes and colours in images, and explore different approaches to measure semantic similarity between the categories of detected visual elements and words in phrases. Experiments on two well-known phrase localization datasets show that this approach surpasses all weakly supervised methods by a large margin and performs very competitively to strongly supervised methods, and can thus be considered a strong baseline to the task.

However, existing methods over-simplify the composite nature of language into a monolithic sentence embedding or a coarse composition of subject-predicate-object triplet. In this paper, we propose to ground natural language in an intuitive, explainable, and composite fashion as it should be. In particular, we develop a novel modular network called Neural Module Tree network (NMTree) that regularizes the visual grounding along the dependency parsing tree of the sentence, where each node is a neural module that calculates visual attention according to its linguistic feature, and the grounding score is accumulated in a bottom-up direction where as needed. NMTree disentangles the visual grounding from the composite reasoning, allowing the former to only focus on primitive and easy-to-generalize patterns. To reduce the impact of parsing errors, we train the modules and their assembly end-to-end by using the Gumbel-Softmax approximation and its straight-through gradient estimator, accounting for the discrete nature of module assembly. Overall, the proposed NMTree consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts on several benchmarks.

To avoid this caveat, we propose a one-stage model that enables end-to-end joint optimization. The main idea is as straightforward as fusing a text query's embedding into the YOLOv3 object detector, augmented by spatial features so as to account for spatial mentions in the query.

Extensive experiments show that our attack is better or competitive to the state of the art. Moreover, we can integrate additional bounds on the componentwise perturbation. Allowing pixels to change only in region of high variation and avoiding changes along axis-aligned edges makes our adversarial examples almost non-perceivable.

It would also reveal the actions of non-linearities because the resulting linear system, a Linear Interpreter, depends on the input image. We introduce a hooking layer, called a LinearScope, which allows us to run the network and the linear interpreter in parallel. Its implementation is simple, flexible and efficient. From here we can make many curious inquiries: how do these linear systems look like? When the rows and columns of the transformation matrix are images, how do they look like?

Many recent methods have proposed to improve adversarial robustness by utilizing adversarial training or model distillation, which adds additional procedures to model training. In this paper, we propose a new training paradigm called Guided Complement Entropy (GCE) that is capable of achieving ""adversarial defense for free,"" which involves no additional procedures in the process of improving adversarial robustness. In addition to maximizing model probabilities on the ground-truth class like cross-entropy, we neutralize its probabilities on the incorrect classes along with a ""guided"" term to balance between these two terms. We show in the experiments that our method achieves better model robustness with even better performance compared to the commonly used cross-entropy training objective.

Such decision-based attacks usually require lots of queries, while real-world image recognition systems might actually restrict the number of queries.

Existing UAP methods mainly focus on attacking image classification models. Nevertheless, little attention has been paid to attacking image retrieval systems. In this paper, we make the first attempt in attacking image retrieval systems. Concretely, image retrieval attack is to make the retrieval system return irrelevant images to the query at the top ranking list. It plays an important role to corrupt the neighbourhood relationships among features in image retrieval attack. To this end, we propose a novel method to generate retrieval-against UAP to break the neighbourhood relationships of image features via degrading the corresponding ranking metric. To expand the attack method to scenarios with varying input sizes or untouchable network parameters, a multi-scale random resizing scheme and a ranking distillation strategy are proposed. We evaluate the proposed method on four widely-used image retrieval datasets, and report a significant performance drop in terms of different metrics, such as mAP and mP@10.

Rezende, Cesar Roberto de Souza"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 5107-5116","Image retrieval can be formulated as a ranking problem where the goal is to order database images by decreasing similarity to the query. Recent deep models for image retrieval have outperformed traditional methods by leveraging ranking-tailored loss functions, but important theoretical and practical problems remain. First, rather than directly optimizing the global ranking, they minimize an upper-bound on the essential loss, which does not necessarily result in an optimal mean average precision (mAP). Second, these methods require significant engineering efforts to work well, e.g., special pre-training and hard-negative mining. In this paper we propose instead to directly optimize the global mAP by leveraging recent advances in listwise loss formulations. Using a histogram binning approximation, the AP can be differentiated and thus employed to end-to-end learning. Compared to existing losses, the proposed method considers thousands of images simultaneously at each iteration and eliminates the need for ad hoc tricks. It also establishes a new state of the art on many standard retrieval benchmarks.

Weakly Aligned Cross-Modal Learning for Multispectral Pedestrian Detection,"Lu Zhang, Xiangyu Zhu, Xiangyu Chen, Xu Yang, Zhen Lei, Zhiyong Liu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 5127-5137","Multispectral pedestrian detection has shown great advantages under poor illumination conditions, since the thermal modality provides complementary information for the color image. However, real multispectral data suffers from the position shift problem, i.e. the color-thermal image pairs are not strictly aligned, making one object has different positions in different modalities. In deep learning based methods, this problem makes it difficult to fuse the feature maps from both modalities and puzzles the CNN training. In this paper, we propose a novel Aligned Region CNN (AR-CNN) to handle the weakly aligned multispectral data in an end-to-end way. Firstly, we design a Region Feature Alignment (RFA) module to capture the position shift and adaptively align the region features of the two modalities. Secondly, we present a new multimodal fusion method, which performs feature re-weighting to select more reliable features and suppress the useless ones. Besides, we propose a novel RoI jitter strategy to improve the robustness to unexpected shift patterns of different devices and system settings. Finally, since our method depends on a new kind of labelling: bounding boxes that match each modality, we manually relabel the KAIST dataset by locating bounding boxes in both modalities and building their relationships, providing a new KAIST-Paired Annotation.

Self-Supervised Difference Detection for Weakly-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Wataru Shimoda, Keiji Yanai"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 5208-5217","To minimize the annotation costs associated with the training of semantic segmentation models, researchers have extensively investigated weakly-supervised segmentation approaches. In the current weakly-supervised segmentation methods, the most widely adopted approach is based on visualization. However, the visualization results are not generally equal to semantic segmentation. Therefore, to perform accurate semantic segmentation under the weakly supervised condition, it is necessary to consider the mapping functions that convert the visualization results into semantic segmentation. For such mapping functions, the conditional random field and iterative re-training using the outputs of a segmentation model are usually used. However, these methods do not always guarantee improvements in accuracy; therefore, if we apply these mapping functions iteratively multiple times, eventually the accuracy will not improve or will decrease. In this paper, to make the most of such mapping functions, we assume that the results of the mapping function include noise, and we improve the accuracy by removing noise. To achieve our aim, we propose the self-supervised difference detection module, which estimates noise from the results of the mapping functions by predicting the difference between the segmentation masks before and after the mapping. We verified the effectiveness of the proposed method by performing experiments on the PASCAL Visual Object Classes 2012 dataset, and we achieved 64.9% in the val set and 65.5% in the test set.

Key to this architecture is a new type of gates that connect the intermediate layers of the two streams. Specifically, we use the higher-level activations in the classical stream to gate the lower-level activations in the shape stream, effectively removing noise and helping the shape stream to only focus on processing the relevant boundary-related information. This enables us to use a very shallow architecture for the shape stream that operates on the image-level resolution.

Could further gains in computational efficiency be achieved by guiding the search via measurements of a high performing network with unknown detailed architecture (e.g. the primate visual system)? As one step toward this goal, we use representational similarity analysis to evaluate the similarity of internal activations of candidate networks with those of a (fixed, high performing) teacher network. We show that adopting this evaluation metric could produce up to an order of magnitude in search efficiency over performance-guided methods. Our approach finds a convolutional cell structure with similar performance as was previously found using other methods but at a total computational cost that is two orders of magnitude lower than Neural Architecture Search (NAS) and more than four times lower than progressive neural architecture search (PNAS).

Different from the existing methods try to obtain all the complex 3D pose, shape, and camera parameters from one coupling feature, we propose a skeleton-disentangling based framework, which divides this task into multi-level spatial and temporal granularity in a decoupling manner. In spatial, we propose an effective and pluggable ""disentangling the skeleton from the details"" (DSD) module. It reduces the complexity and decouples the skeleton, which lays a good foundation for temporal modeling. In temporal, the self-attention based temporal convolution network is proposed to efficiently exploit the short and long-term temporal cues. Furthermore, an unsupervised adversarial training strategy, temporal shuffles and order recovery, is designed to promote the learning of motion dynamics.

Black"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 5359-5368","We present the first method to perform automatic 3D pose, shape and texture capture of animals from images acquired in-the-wild. In particular, we focus on the problem of capturing 3D information about Grevy's zebras from a collection of images. The Grevy's zebra is one of the most endangered species in Africa, with only a few thousand individuals left. Capturing the shape and pose of these animals can provide biologists and conservationists with information about animal health and behavior. In contrast to research on human pose, shape and texture estimation, training data for endangered species is limited, the animals are in complex natural scenes with occlusion, they are naturally camouflaged, travel in herds, and look similar to each other. To overcome these challenges, we integrate the recent SMAL animal model into a network-based regression pipeline, which we train end-to-end on synthetically generated images with pose, shape, and background variation. Going beyond state-of-the-art methods for human shape and pose estimation, our method learns a shape space for zebras during training. Learning such a shape space from images using only a photometric loss is novel, and the approach can be used to learn shape in other settings with limited 3D supervision. Moreover, we couple 3D pose and shape prediction with the task of texture synthesis, obtaining a full texture map of the animal from a single image. We show that the predicted texture map allows a novel per-instance unsupervised optimization over the network features.

In order to perform dense 4D reconstruction from images or sparse point clouds, we combine our method with a continuous 3D representation. Implicitly, our model yields correspondences over time, thus enabling fast inference while providing a sound physical description of the temporal dynamics.

Considering that human shapes are of high dimensions and with large articulations, we adopt the state-of-the-art parametric human body model, SMPL, to reduce the dimension of learning space and generate smooth and valid reconstruction. However, SMPL parameters, especially pose parameters, are not easy to learn because of ambiguity and locality of the pose representation. Thus, we propose to incorporate skeleton awareness into the deep learning based regression of SMPL parameters for 3D human shape reconstruction. Our basic idea is to use the state-of-the-art technique PointNet++ to extract point features, and then map point features to skeleton joint features and finally to SMPL parameters for the reconstruction from point clouds. Particularly, we develop an end-to-end framework, where we propose a graph aggregation module to augment PointNet++ by extracting better point features, an attention module to better map unordered point features into ordered skeleton joint features, and a skeleton graph module to extract better joint features for SMPL parameter regression.

In contrast, existing human motion capture (mocap) datasets are small and the motions limited, hampering progress on learning models of human motion. While there are many different datasets available, they each use a different parameterization of the body, making it difficult to integrate them into a single meta dataset. To address this, we introduce AMASS, a large and varied database of human motion that unifies 15 different optical marker-based mocap datasets by representing them within a common framework and parameterization. We achieve this using a new method, MoSh++, that converts mocap data into realistic 3D human meshes represented by a rigged body model. Here we use SMPL [Loper et al., 2015], which is widely used and provides a standard skeletal representation as well as a fully rigged surface mesh. The method works for arbitrary marker sets, while recovering soft-tissue dynamics and realistic hand motion. We evaluate MoSh++ and tune its hyperparameters using a new dataset of 4D body scans that are jointly recorded with markerbased mocap. The consistent representation of AMASS makes it readily useful for animation, visualization, and generating training data for deep learning.

In this paper, we take one step forward to show that fine-grained person perception is possible even with 1D sensors: WiFi antennas. Specifically, we used two sets of WiFi antennas to acquire signals, i.e., one transmitter set and one receiver set. Each set contains three antennas horizontally lined-up as a regular household WiFi router. The WiFi signal generated by a transmitter antenna, penetrates through and reflects on human bodies, furniture, and walls, and then superposes at a receiver antenna as 1D signal samples. We developed a deep learning approach that uses annotations on 2D images, takes the received 1D WiFi signals as input, and performs body segmentation and pose estimation in an end-to-end manner. To our knowledge, our solution is the first work based on off-the-shelf WiFi antennas and standard IEEE 802.11n WiFi signals.

The AFRN represents the face by all possible pairs of the 9x9 local appearance block features, the importance of each pair is considered by the attention map that is obtained from the low-rank bilinear pooling, and each pair is weighted by its corresponding attention score. To increase the accuracy, we select top-K pairs of local appearance block features as relevant facial information and drop the remaining irrelevant. The weighted top-K pairs are propagated to extract the joint feature-pair relation by using bilinear attention network. In experiments, we show the effectiveness of the proposed AFRN and achieve the outstanding performance in the 1:1 face verification and 1:N face identification tasks compared to existing state-of-the-art methods on the challenging LFW, YTF, CALFW, CPLFW, CFP, AgeDB, IJB-A, IJB-B, and IJB-C datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Kang_Attentional_Feature-Pair_Relation_Networks_for_Accurate_Face_Recognition_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

Existing WSAD methods detect action instances by scoring each video segment (a stack of frames) individually. Most of them fail to model the temporal relations among video segments and cannot effectively characterize action instances possessing latent temporal structure. To alleviate this problem in WSAD, we propose the temporal structure mining (TSM) approach. In TSM, each action instance is modeled as a multi-phase process and phase evolving within an action instance, i.e., the temporal structure, is exploited. Meanwhile, the video background is modeled by a background phase, which separates different action instances in an untrimmed video. In this framework, phase filters are used to calculate the confidence scores of the presence of an action's phases in each segment. Since in the WSAD task, frame-level annotations are not available and thus phase filters cannot be trained directly. To tackle the challenge, we treat each segment's phase as a hidden variable. We use segments' confidence scores from each phase filter to construct a table and determine hidden variables, i.e., phases of segments, by a maximal circulant path discovery along the table.

Video Classification With Channel-Separated Convolutional Networks,"Du Tran, Heng Wang, Lorenzo Torresani, Matt Feiszli"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 5552-5561","Group convolution has been shown to offer great computational savings in various 2D convolutional architectures for image classification. It is natural to ask: 1) if group convolution can help to alleviate the high computational cost of video classification networks; 2) what factors matter the most in 3D group convolutional networks; and 3) what are good computation/accuracy trade-offs with 3D group convolutional networks. This paper studies the effects of different design choices in 3D group convolutional networks for video classification. We empirically demonstrate that the amount of channel interactions plays an important role in the accuracy of 3D group convolutional networks. Our experiments suggest two main findings. First, it is a good practice to factorize 3D convolutions by separating channel interactions and spatiotemporal interactions as this leads to improved accuracy and lower computational cost.

The proposed model is further endowed with a supervised, human-aware attention mechanism in an end-to-end fashion. It learns a soft mask that encodes FG human information and explicitly drives the FG/BG decoder-branches to focus on their specific domains.

To further benefit the research towards Human-aware Image Deblurring, we introduce a large-scale dataset, named HIDE, which consists of 8,422 blurry and sharp image pairs with 65,784 densely annotated FG human bounding boxes.

Our method learns a network-based projector for use in the PGD algorithm, eliminating expensive computation of the Jacobian of G. Experiments show that our approach provides a speed-up of 60-80x over earlier GAN-based recovery methods along with better accuracy in compressed sensing. Our main theoretical result is that if the measurement matrix is moderately conditioned on the manifold range(G) and the projector is d-approximate, then the algorithm is guaranteed to reach O(d) reconstruction error in O(log(1/d)) steps in the low noise regime. Additionally, we propose a fast method to design such measurement matrices for a given G. Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of this method by requiring 5-10x fewer measurements than random Gaussian measurement matrices for comparable recovery performance.

By interpreting the de-raining encoder-decoder network as a conditional generator, within which the decoder acts as a generator conditioned on the embedding learned by the encoder, the unsatisfactory output can be attributed to the low-quality embedding learned by the encoder. In this paper, we hypothesize that there exists an inherent mapping between the low-quality embedding to a latent optimal one, with which the generator (decoder) can produce much better results. To improve the de-raining results significantly over existing models, we propose to learn this mapping by formulating a residual learning branch, that is capable of adaptively adding residuals to the original low-quality embedding in a representation entanglement manner.

We introduce a learning signal inspired by creativity literature that explores the unseen space with hallucinated class-descriptions and encourages careful deviation of their visual feature generations from seen classes while allowing knowledge transfer from seen to unseen classes. Empirically, we show consistent improvement over the state of the art of several percents on the largest available benchmarks on the challenging task or generalized ZSL from a noisy text that we focus on, using the CUB and NABirds datasets. We also show the advantage of our loss on Attribute-based ZSL on three additional datasets (AwA2, aPY, and SUN).

Generating Easy-to-Understand Referring Expressions for Target Identifications,"Mikihiro Tanaka, Takayuki Itamochi, Kenichi Narioka, Ikuro Sato, Yoshitaka Ushiku, Tatsuya Harada"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 5794-5803","This paper addresses the generation of referring expressions that not only refer to objects correctly but also let humans find them quickly. As a target becomes relatively less salient, identifying referred objects itself becomes more difficult. However, the existing studies regarded all sentences that refer to objects correctly as equally good, ignoring whether they are easily understood by humans. If the target is not salient, humans utilize relationships with the salient contexts around it to help listeners to comprehend it better. To derive this information from human annotations, our model is designed to extract information from the target and from the environment. Moreover, we regard that sentences that are easily understood are those that are comprehended correctly and quickly by humans. We optimized this by using the time required to locate the referred objects by humans and their accuracies. To evaluate our system, we created a new referring expression dataset whose images were acquired from Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V), limiting targets to persons.

Most prior work focuses on the latter challenge, by introducing loss functions that help the network learn better feature representations but fail to account for the complexity of the textual input. With that in mind, we introduce TIMAM: a Text-Image Modality Adversarial Matching approach that learns modality-invariant feature representations using adversarial and cross-modal matching objectives.

The cross-modality information between the latent summarizations are propagated to fuse valuable information from both modalities and are used to update the visual and word features. Such MLI modules can be stacked for several stages to model complex and latent relations between the two modalities and achieves highly competitive performance on public VQA benchmarks, VQA v2.0 and TDIUC .

CutMix: Regularization Strategy to Train Strong Classifiers With Localizable Features,"Sangdoo Yun, Dongyoon Han, Seong Joon Oh, Sanghyuk Chun, Junsuk Choe, Youngjoon Yoo"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 6023-6032","Regional dropout strategies have been proposed to enhance performance of convolutional neural network classifiers. They have proved to be effective for guiding the model to attend on less discriminative parts of objects (e.g. leg as opposed to head of a person), thereby letting the network generalize better and have better object localization capabilities. On the other hand, current methods for regional dropout removes informative pixels on training images by overlaying a patch of either black pixels or random noise. Such removal is not desirable because it suffers from information loss causing inefficiency in training. We therefore propose the CutMix augmentation strategy: patches are cut and pasted among training images where the ground truth labels are also mixed proportionally to the area of the patches. By making efficient use of training pixels and retaining the regularization effect of regional dropout, CutMix consistently outperforms state-of-the-art augmentation strategies on CIFAR and ImageNet classification tasks, as well as on ImageNet weakly-supervised localization task. Moreover, unlike previous augmentation methods, our CutMix-trained ImageNet classifier, when used as a pretrained model, results in consistent performance gain in Pascal detection and MS-COCO image captioning benchmarks. We also show that CutMix can improve the model robustness against input corruptions and its out-of distribution detection performance.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Yun_CutMix_Regularization_Strategy_to_Train_Strong_Classifiers_With_Localizable_Features_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv
Towards Interpretable Object Detection by Unfolding Latent Structures,"Tianfu Wu, Xi Song"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 6033-6043","This paper first proposes a method of formulating model interpretability in visual understanding tasks based on the idea of unfolding latent structures. It then presents a case study in object detection using popular two-stage region-based convolutional network (i.e., R-CNN) detection systems. The proposed method focuses on weakly-supervised extractive rationale generation, that is learning to unfold latent discriminative part configurations of object instances automatically and simultaneously in detection without using any supervision for part configurations. It utilizes a top-down hierarchical and compositional grammar model embedded in a directed acyclic AND-OR Graph (AOG) to explore and unfold the space of latent part configurations of regions of interest (RoIs). It presents an AOGParsing operator that seamlessly integrates with the RoIPooling/RoIAlign operator widely used in R-CNN and is trained end-to-end. In object detection, a bounding box is interpreted by the best parse tree derived from the AOG on-the-fly, which is treated as the qualitatively extractive rationale generated for interpreting detection. In experiments, Faster R-CNN is used to test the proposed method on the PASCAL VOC 2007 and the COCO 2017 object detection datasets.

In this work we explore this problem from a generative modeling perspective by learning to generate new images with associated bounding boxes, and using these for training an object detector. We show that simply training previously proposed generative models does not yield satisfactory performance due to them optimizing for image realism rather than object detection accuracy.

Transductive Learning for Zero-Shot Object Detection,"Shafin Rahman, Salman Khan, Nick Barnes"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 6082-6091","Zero-shot object detection (ZSD) is a relatively unexplored research problem as compared to the conventional zero-shot recognition task. ZSD aims to detect previously unseen objects during inference. Existing ZSD works suffer from two critical issues: (a) large domain-shift between the source (seen) and target (unseen) domains since the two distributions are highly mismatched. (b) the learned model is biased against unseen classes, therefore in generalized ZSD settings, where both seen and unseen objects co-occur during inference, the learned model tends to misclassify unseen to seen categories. This brings up an important question: How effectively can a transductive setting address the aforementioned problems? To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose a transductive zero-shot object detection approach that convincingly reduces the domain-shift and model-bias against unseen classes. Our approach is based on a self-learning mechanism that uses a novel hybrid pseudo-labeling technique. It progressively updates learned model parameters by associating unlabeled data samples to their corresponding classes.

However, supervised learning-based methods perform poorly when the train data and the test data have different distributions. To address the issue, domain adaptation transfers knowledge from the label-sufficient domain (source domain) to the label-scarce domain (target domain). Self-training is one of the powerful ways to achieve domain adaptation since it helps class-wise domain adaptation. Unfortunately, a naive approach that utilizes pseudo-labels as ground-truth degenerates the performance due to incorrect pseudo-labels. In this paper, we introduce a weak self-training (WST) method and adversarial background score regularization (BSR) for domain adaptive one-stage object detection. WST diminishes the adverse effects of inaccurate pseudo-labels to stabilize the learning procedure. BSR helps the network extract discriminative features for target backgrounds to reduce the domain shift.

A suitable frame sampling strategy can improve the accuracy and efficiency of recognition. However, mainstream solutions generally adopt hand-crafted frame sampling strategies for recognition. It could degrade the performance, especially in untrimmed videos, due to the variation of frame-level saliency. To this end, we concentrate on improving untrimmed video classification via developing a learning-based frame sampling strategy. We intuitively formulate the frame sampling procedure as multiple parallel Markov decision processes, each of which aims at picking out a frame/clip by gradually adjusting an initial sampling. Then we propose to solve the problems with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL).

SCSampler: Sampling Salient Clips From Video for Efficient Action Recognition,"Bruno Korbar, Du Tran, Lorenzo Torresani"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 6232-6242","While many action recognition datasets consist of collections of brief, trimmed videos each containing a relevant action, videos in the real-world (e.g., on YouTube) exhibit very different properties: they are often several minutes long, where brief relevant clips are often interleaved with segments of extended duration containing little change. Applying densely an action recognition system to every temporal clip within such videos is prohibitively expensive. Furthermore, as we show in our experiments, this results in suboptimal recognition accuracy as informative predictions from relevant clips are outnumbered by meaningless classification outputs over long uninformative sections of the video. In this paper we introduce a lightweight ""clip-sampling"" model that can efficiently identify the most salient temporal clips within a long video. We demonstrate that the computational cost of action recognition on untrimmed videos can be dramatically reduced by invoking recognition only on these most salient clips. Furthermore, we show that this yields significant gains in recognition accuracy compared to analysis of all clips or randomly selected clips. On Sports1M, our clip sampling scheme elevates the accuracy of an already state-of-the-art action classifier by 7% and reduces by more than 15 times its computational cost.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Korbar_SCSampler_Sampling_Salient_Clips_From_Video_for_Efficient_Action_Recognition_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

This task is to localize a visible and audible event in a video. Previous methods first divide a video into short segments, and then fuse visual and acoustic features at the segment level. The duration of these segments is usually short, making the visual and acoustic feature of each segment possibly not well aligned. Direct concatenation of the two features at the segment level can be vulnerable to a minor temporal misalignment of the two signals. We propose a Dual Attention Matching (DAM) module to cover a longer video duration for better high-level event information modeling, while the local temporal information is attained by the global cross-check mechanism. Our premise is that one should watch the whole video to understand the high-level event, while shorter segments should be checked in detail for localization. Specifically, the global feature of one modality queries the local feature in the other modality in a bi-directional way. With temporal co-occurrence encoded between auditory and visual signals, DAM can be readily applied in various audio-visual event localization tasks, e.g., cross-modality localization, supervised event localization.

However, this method does not explicitly guarantee that the learned landmarks are consistent with changes between different instances of the same object, such as different facial identities. In this paper, we develop a new perspective on the equivariance approach by noting that dense landmark detectors can be interpreted as local image descriptors equipped with invariance to intra-category variations. We then propose a direct method to enforce such an invariance in the standard equivariant loss. We do so by exchanging descriptor vectors between images of different object instances prior to matching them geometrically. In this manner, the same vectors must work regardless of the specific object identity considered. We use this approach to learn vectors that can simultaneously be interpreted as local descriptors and dense landmarks, combining the advantages of both.

Therefore, our method unifies model-based and similarity-based approaches for clustering. To combine graph embedding with probabilistic deep GMM, we propose a novel stochastic extension of graph embedding: we treat samples as nodes on a graph and minimize the weighted distance between their posterior distributions. We apply Jenson-Shannon divergence as the distance. We combine the divergence minimization with the log-likelihood maximization of the deep GMM. We derive formulations to obtain an unified objective that enables simultaneous deep representation learning and clustering. Our experimental results show that our proposed DGG outperforms recent deep Gaussian mixture methods (model-based) and deep spectral clustering (similarity-based). Our results highlight advantages of combining model-based and similarity-based clustering as proposed in this work.

SoftTriple Loss: Deep Metric Learning Without Triplet Sampling,"Qi Qian, Lei Shang, Baigui Sun, Juhua Hu, Hao Li, Rong Jin"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 6450-6458","Distance metric learning (DML) is to learn the embeddings where examples from the same class are closer than examples from different classes. It can be cast as an optimization problem with triplet constraints. Due to the vast number of triplet constraints, a sampling strategy is essential for DML. With the tremendous success of deep learning in classifications, it has been applied for DML. When learning embeddings with deep neural networks (DNNs), only a mini-batch of data is available at each iteration. The set of triplet constraints has to be sampled within the mini-batch. Since a mini-batch cannot capture the neighbors in the original set well, it makes the learned embeddings sub-optimal. On the contrary, optimizing SoftMax loss, which is a classification loss, with DNN shows a superior performance in certain DML tasks. It inspires us to investigate the formulation of SoftMax. Our analysis shows that SoftMax loss is equivalent to a smoothed triplet loss where each class has a single center. In real-world data, one class can contain several local clusters rather than a single one, e.g., birds of different poses. Therefore, we propose the SoftTriple loss to extend the SoftMax loss with multiple centers for each class. Compared with conventional deep metric learning algorithms, optimizing SoftTriple loss can learn the embeddings without the sampling phase by mildly increasing the size of the last fully connected layer.

The objects grouped within the same coarse category, but in different fine categories, usually share a set of global visual features; however, these objects have distinctive local properties that characterize them at a fine level. This paper addresses the challenge of fine image classification in a weakly supervised fashion, whereby a subset of images is tagged by fine labels, while the remaining are tagged by coarse labels. We propose a new deep model that leverages coarse images to improve the classification performance of fine images within the coarse category. Our model is an end to end framework consisting of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which uses both fine and coarse images to tune its parameters. The CNN outputs are then fanned out into two separate branches such that the first branch uses a supervised low rank self expressive layer to project the CNN outputs to the low rank subspaces to capture the global structures for the coarse classification, while the other branch uses a supervised sparse self expressive layer to project them to the sparse subspaces to capture the local structures for the fine classification. Our deep model uses coarse images in conjunction with fine images to jointly explore the low rank and sparse subspaces by sharing the parameters during the training which causes the data points obtained by the CNN to be well-projected to both sparse and low rank subspaces for classification.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Taherkhani_A_Weakly_Supervised_Fine_Label_Classifier_Enhanced_by_Coarse_Supervision_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

Thus, even if two mixture distributions have identical mixture components but different mixture proportions, the Wasserstein distance between them will be large. This often leads to undesired results in distance-based learning methods for mixture distributions. In this paper, we resolve this issue by introducing the Normalized Wasserstein measure. The key idea is to introduce mixture proportions as optimization variables, effectively normalizing mixture proportions in the Wasserstein formulation.

The proposed defence mechanism is inspired by the recent works mitigating the adversarial disturbances by the means of image reconstruction and denoising. However, unlike the previous works, we apply the reconstruction only for small and carefully selected image areas that are most influential to the current classification outcome. The selection process is guided by the class activation map responses obtained for multiple top-ranking class labels. The same regions are also the most prominent for the adversarial perturbations and hence most important to purify. The resulting inpainting task is substantially more tractable than the full image reconstruction, while still being able to prevent the adversarial attacks. Furthermore, we combine the selective image inpainting with wavelet based image denoising to produce a non differentiable layer that prevents attacker from using gradient backpropagation. Moreover, the proposed nonlinearity cannot be easily approximated with simple differentiable alternative as demonstrated in the experiments with Backward Pass Differentiable Approximation (BPDA) attack.

The mean of the distribution estimates the most likely feature values while the variance shows the uncertainty in the feature values. Probabilistic solutions can then be naturally derived for matching and fusing PFEs using the uncertainty information.

In particular, DKD introduces a light-weight distillator to online distill pose kernels via leveraging temporal cues from the previous frame in a one-shot feed-forward manner.

Existing methods are mostly two-stage based-one stage for proposal generation and the other for allocating poses to corresponding persons. However, such two-stage methods generally suffer low efficiency. In this work, we present the first single-stage model, Single-stage multi-person Pose Machine (SPM), to simplify the pipeline and lift the efficiency for multi-person pose estimation. To achieve this, we propose a novel Structured Pose Representation (SPR) that unifies person instance and body joint position representations.

In particular, SPR introduces the root joints to indicate different person instances and human body joint positions are encoded into their displacements w.r.t. the roots. To better predict long-range displacements for some joints, SPR is further extended to hierarchical representations. Based on SPR, SPM can efficiently perform multi-person poses estimation by simultaneously predicting root joints (location of instances) and body joint displacements via CNNs. Moreover, to demonstrate the generality of SPM, we also apply it to multi-person 3D pose estimation.

However, when the testing image is challenging due to low resolution, occlusion or adversarial attacks, the accuracy of a deep neural network suffers greatly. Therefore, it is important to quantify the uncertainty in its predictions. A probabilistic neural network with Gaussian distribution over the target is typically used to quantify uncertainty for regression problems. However, in real-world problems especially computer vision tasks, the Gaussian assumption is too strong. To model more general distributions, such as multi-modal or asymmetric distributions, we propose to develop a kernel density deep neural network.

The model is trained by maximizing the conditional log likelihood. To exploit the output probability map, we extend the model to multi-stage so that the logits map from the previous stage can feed into the next stage to progressively improve the landmark detection accuracy.

Nevertheless, the problem is not trivial especially when exploring the interactions between objects to boost video object detectors. The difficulty originates from the aspect that reliable object relations in a video should depend on not only the objects in the present frame but also all the supportive objects extracted over a long range span of the video. In this paper, we introduce a new design to capture the interactions across the objects in spatio-temporal context. Specifically, we present Relation Distillation Networks (RDN) --- a new architecture that novelly aggregates and propagates object relation to augment object features for detection. Technically, object proposals are first generated via Region Proposal Networks (RPN).

Fast Object Detection in Compressed Video,"Shiyao Wang, Hongchao Lu, Zhidong Deng"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 7104-7113","Object detection in videos has drawn increasing attention since it is more practical in real scenarios. Most of the deep learning methods use CNNs to process each decoded frame in a video stream individually. However, the free of charge yet valuable motion information already embedded in the video compression format is usually overlooked. In this paper, we propose a fast object detection method by taking advantage of this with a novel Motion aided Memory Network (MMNet). The MMNet has two major advantages: 1) It significantly accelerates the procedure of feature extraction for compressed videos. It only need to run a complete recognition network for I-frames, i.e. a few reference frames in a video, and it produces the features for the following P frames (predictive frames) with a light weight memory network, which runs fast; 2) Unlike existing methods that establish an additional network to model motion of frames, we take full advantage of both motion vectors and residual errors that are freely available in video streams. To our best knowledge, the MMNet is the first work that investigates a deep convolutional detector on compressed videos. Our method is evaluated on the large-scale ImageNet VID dataset, and the results show that it is 3x times faster than single image detector R-FCN and 10x times faster than high-performance detector MANet at a minor accuracy loss.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Wang_Fast_Object_Detection_in_Compressed_Video_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

While recent GANs have shown promising results, they can only forecast plausible motion over relatively short periods of time (few hundred milliseconds) and typically ignore the absolute position of the skeleton w.r.t. the camera. Our scheme provides long term predictions (two seconds or more) for both the body pose and its absolute position. Our approach builds upon three main contributions. First, we represent the data using a spatio-temporal tensor of 3D skeleton coordinates which allows formulating the prediction problem as an inpainting one, for which GANs work particularly well. Secondly, we design an architecture to learn the joint distribution of body poses and global motion, capable to hypothesize large chunks of the input 3D tensor with missing data. And finally, we argue that the L2 metric, considered so far by most approaches, fails to capture the actual distribution of long-term human motion.

This is implemented via a hierarchy of small-sized neural networks connected analogously to the kinematic chains in the human body as well as a joint-wise decomposition in the loss function.

Yet humans understand a scene not in terms of pixels, but by decomposing it into perceptual groups and structures that are the basic building blocks of recognition. This motivates us to propose an end-to-end pixel-wise metric learning approach that mimics this process. In our approach, the optimal visual representation determines the right segmentation within individual images and associates segments with the same semantic classes across images. The core visual learning problem is therefore to maximize the similarity within segments and minimize the similarity between segments. Given a model trained this way, inference is performed consistently by extracting pixel-wise embeddings and clustering, with the semantic label determined by the majority vote of its nearest neighbors from an annotated set. As a result, we present the SegSort, as a first attempt using deep learning for unsupervised semantic segmentation, achieving 76% performance of its supervised counterpart. When supervision is available, SegSort shows consistent improvements over conventional approaches based on pixel-wise softmax training.

What Synthesis Is Missing: Depth Adaptation Integrated With Weak Supervision for Indoor Scene Parsing,"Keng-Chi Liu, Yi-Ting Shen, Jan P.

Supervised deep learning methods have made great progress in solving scene parsing problems, however, come at the cost of laborious manual pixel-level annotation. Synthetic data as well as weak supervision have been investigated to alleviate this effort. Nonetheless, synthetically generated data still suffers from severe domain shift while weak labels often lack precision. Moreover, most existing works for weakly supervised scene parsing are limited to salient foreground objects. The aim of this work is hence twofold: Exploit synthetic data where feasible and integrate weak supervision where necessary. More concretely, we address this goal by utilizing depth as transfer domain because its synthetic-to-real discrepancy is much lower than for color. At the same time, we perform weak localization from easily obtainable image level labels and integrate both using a novel contour-based scheme. Our approach is implemented as a teacher-student learning framework to solve the transfer learning problem by generating a pseudo ground truth. Using only depth-based adaptation, this approach already outperforms previous transfer learning approaches on the popular indoor scene parsing SUN RGB-D dataset.

A scene graph is decomposed into a sequence of semantic fragments (SF), one for each relationship. A semantic layout is represented as the consequence from a series of brick-action code segments (BACS), dictating the position and scale of each object bounding box in the layout.

HoloGAN instead learns a 3D representation of the world, and to render this representation in a realistic manner. Unlike other GANs, HoloGAN provides explicit control over the pose of generated objects through rigid-body transformations of the learnt 3D features. Our experiments show that using explicit 3D features enables HoloGAN to disentangle 3D pose and identity, which is further decomposed into shape and appearance, while still being able to generate images with similar or higher visual quality than other generative models. HoloGAN can be trained end-to-end from unlabelled 2D images only. Particularly, we do not require pose labels, 3D shapes, or multiple views of the same objects.

Training these models typically requires paired data with direct correspondence between modalities. We introduce the novel problem of translating instances from one modality to another without paired data by leveraging an intermediate modality shared by the two other modalities. To demonstrate this, we take the problem of translating images to speech. In this case, one could leverage disjoint datasets with one shared modality, e.g., image-text pairs and text-speech pairs, with text as the shared modality. We call this problem ""skip-modal generation"" because the shared modality is skipped during the generation process. We propose a multimodal information bottleneck approach that learns the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data (image and speech) by leveraging the shared modality (text). We address fundamental challenges of skip-modal generation: 1) learning multimodal representations using a single model, 2) bridging the domain gap between two unrelated datasets, and 3) learning the correspondence between modalities from unpaired data. We show qualitative results on image-to-speech synthesis; this is the first time such results have been reported in the literature.

Classic stereo algorithms and prior learning-based depth estimation techniques underperform when applied on this dual-pixel data, the former due to too-strong assumptions about RGB image matching, and the latter due to not leveraging the understanding of optics of dual-pixel image formation.

For example, the limbs may move more flexibly and freely than the torso does. Most of the existing 3D pose estimation methods, despite the very promising results achieved, treat the body joints equally and consequently often lead to larger reconstruction errors on the limbs. In this paper, we propose a progressive approach that explicitly accounts for the distinct DOFs among the body parts. We model parts with higher DOFs like the elbows, as dependent components of the corresponding parts with lower DOFs like the torso, of which the 3D locations can be more reliably estimated. Meanwhile, the high-DOF parts may, in turn, impose a constraint on where the low-DOF ones lie. As a result, parts with different DOFs supervise one another, yielding physically constrained and plausible pose-estimation results. To further facilitate the prediction of the high-DOF parts, we introduce a pose-attribution estimation, where the relative location of a limb joint with respect to the torso, which has the least DOF of a human body, is explicitly estimated and further fed to the joint-estimation module.

We begin by tracking a few salient feature points across the frames of a video sequence of the submerged scene. Using these point trajectories, we show that the motion fields at all other (non-tracked) points can be effectively estimated using a typical CS solver.

In this paper, we propose stochastic exposure coding (SEC), a novel approach for mitigating. SEC involves dividing a camera's integration time into multiple slots, and switching the camera off and on stochastically during each slot. This approach has two benefits. First, by appropriately choosing the on probability for each slot, the camera can effectively filter out both the AC and DC components of interfering signals, thereby mitigating depth errors while also maintaining high signal-to-noise ratio. This enables high accuracy depth recovery with low power consumption. Second, this approach can be implemented without modifying the C-ToF camera's coding functions, and thus, can be used with a wide range of cameras with minimal changes.

MIC: Mining Interclass Characteristics for Improved Metric Learning,"Karsten Roth, Biagio Brattoli, Bjorn Ommer"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 8000-8009","Metric learning seeks to embed images of objects such that class-defined relations are captured by the embedding space. However, variability in images is not just due to different depicted object classes, but also depends on other latent characteristics such as viewpoint or illumination. In addition to these structured properties, random noise further obstructs the visual relations of interest. The common approach to metric learning is to enforce a representation that is invariant under all factors but the ones of interest. In contrast, we propose to explicitly learn the latent characteristics that are shared by and go across object classes. We can then directly explain away structured visual variability, rather than assuming it to be unknown random noise. We propose a novel surrogate task to learn visual characteristics shared across classes with a separate encoder. This encoder is trained jointly with the encoder for class information by reducing their mutual information.

Such discriminative and unsupervised representation learning scheme is adaptable to different computer vision tasks due to its independence from intense annotation requirements. We evaluate our proposed method for different tasks, including classification, detection, and segmentation based on the learned latent representations.

The adaptive segment selection enables effective encoding of the essential discriminative information of untrimmed videos. Based on Gaussian Scale Mixture, we compute the weights by extracting the mutual information between two consecutive segments.

Our key idea is to use a pair of orthonormal frames -- as subspaces -- to ""sandwich"" the labeled data via optimizing for two objectives jointly: i) minimize the distance between the origins of the two subspaces, and ii) to maximize the margin between the hyperplanes and the data, either subspace demanding the data to be in its positive and negative orthant respectively. Our proposed objective however leads to a non-convex optimization problem, to which we resort to Riemannian optimization schemes and derive an efficient conjugate gradient scheme on the Stiefel manifold. To study the effectiveness of our scheme, we propose a new dataset Dash-Cam-Pose, consisting of clips with skeleton poses of humans seated in a car, the task being to classify the clips as normal or abnormal; the latter is when any human pose is out-of-position with regard to say an airbag deployment. Our experiments on the proposed Dash-Cam-Pose dataset, as well as several other standard anomaly/novelty detection benchmarks demonstrate the benefits of our scheme, achieving state-of-the-art one-class accuracy.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Wang_GODS_Generalized_One-Class_Discriminative_Subspaces_for_Anomaly_Detection_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

Specifically, we propose a neighborhood attention mechanism which focuses on partial useful content of each input frame conditioned on the neighborhood information. We then integrate the neighborhood attention mechanism into an RNN-based reconstruction scheme to encourage the binary codes to capture the spatial-temporal structure in a video which is consistent with that in the neighborhood.

However, it remains a challenging task for adapting a model trained in a source domain of labelled data to a target domain of only unlabelled data available. In this work, we develop a self-training method with progressive augmentation framework (PAST) to promote the model performance progressively on the target dataset. Specially, our PAST framework consists of two stages, namely, conservative stage and promoting stage. The conservative stage captures the local structure of target-domain data points with triplet-based loss functions, leading to improved feature representations. The promoting stage continuously optimizes the network by appending a changeable classification layer to the last layer of the model, enabling the use of global information about the data distribution. Importantly, we propose a new self-training strategy that progressively augments the model capability by adopting conservative and promoting stages alternately. Furthermore, to improve the reliability of selected triplet samples, we introduce a ranking-based triplet loss in the conservative stage, which is a label-free objective function based on the similarities between data pairs.

Yu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 8252-8261","Deep hashing enables computation and memory efficient image search through end-to-end learning of feature representations and binary codes. While linear scan over binary hash codes is more efficient than over the high-dimensional representations, its linear-time complexity is still unacceptable for very large databases. Hamming space retrieval enables constant-time search through hash lookups, where for each query, there is a Hamming ball centered at the query and the data points within the ball are returned as relevant. Since inside the Hamming ball implies retrievable while outside irretrievable, it is crucial to explicitly characterize the Hamming ball. The main idea of this work is to directly embody the Hamming radius into the loss functions, leading to Maximum-Margin Hamming Hashing (MMHH), a new model specifically optimized for Hamming space retrieval. We introduce a max-margin t-distribution loss, where the t-distribution concentrates more similar data points to be within the Hamming ball, and the margin characterizes the Hamming radius such that less penalization is applied to similar data points within the Hamming ball. The loss function also introduces robustness to data noise, where the similarity supervision may be inaccurate in practical problems. The model is trained end-to-end using a new semi-batch optimization algorithm tailored to extremely imbalanced data.

Learning to Rank Proposals for Object Detection,"Zhiyu Tan, Xuecheng Nie, Qi Qian, Nan Li, Hao Li"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 8273-8281","Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) is an essential step of modern object detection models for removing duplicated candidates. The efficacy of NMS heavily affects the final detection results. Prior works exploit suppression criterions relying on either the objectiveness derived from classification or the overlapness produced by regression, both of which are heuristically designed and fail to explicitly link with the suppression rank. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model to produce the suppression rank via a learning procedure, thus facilitating the candidate generation and lifting the detection performance. In particular, we define a ranking score based on IoU to indicate the ranks of candidates during the NMS step, where candidates with high ranking score will be reserved and the ones with low ranking score will be eliminated. We design a lightweight network to predict the ranking score. We introduce a ranking loss to supervise the generation of these ranking scores, which encourages candidates with IoU to the ground-truth to rank higher. To facilitate the training procedure, we design a novel sampling strategy via dividing candidates into different levels and select hard pairs to adopt in the training. During the inference phase, this module can be exploited as a plugin to the current object detector. The training and inference of the overall framework is end-to-end.

Deep inpainting can fill image regions with plausible contents, which are not visually apparent. Although inpainting is originally designed to repair images, it can even be used for malicious manipulations, e.g., removal of specific objects. Therefore, it is necessary to identify the presence of inpainting in an image. This paper presents a method to locate the regions manipulated by deep inpainting. The proposed method employs a fully convolutional network that is based on high-pass filtered image residuals. Firstly, we analyze and observe that the inpainted regions are more distinguishable from the untouched ones in the residual domain. Hence, a high-pass pre-filtering module is designed to get image residuals for enhancing inpainting traces. Then, a feature extraction module, which learns discriminative features from image residuals, is built with four concatenated ResNet blocks. The learned feature maps are finally enlarged by an up-sampling module, so that a pixel-wise inpainting localization map is obtained.

In this paper, we address both issues inspired by observing that these targets are often clustered. In particular, we propose a Clustered Detection (ClusDet) network that unifies object clustering and detection in an end-to-end framework. The key components in ClusDet include a cluster proposal sub-network (CPNet), a scale estimation sub-network (ScaleNet), and a dedicated detection network (DetecNet). Given an input image, CPNet produces object cluster regions and ScaleNet estimates object scales for these regions. Then, each scale-normalized cluster region is fed into DetecNet for object detection. ClusDet has several advantages over previous solutions: (1) it greatly reduces the number of chips for final object detection and hence achieves high running time efficiency, (2) the cluster-based scale estimation is more accurate than previously used single-object based ones, hence effectively improves the detection for small objects, and (3) the final DetecNet is dedicated for clustered regions and implicitly models the prior context information so as to boost detection accuracy.

Existing methods typically model this task in a regression manner, while they are likely to suffer from an unseen scene with counts out of the scope of the closed set.

The second one is to model the arbitrary-shaped text instance. Recently, some methods have been proposed to tackle arbitrary-shaped text detection, but they rarely take the speed of the entire pipeline into consideration, which may fall short in practical applications. In this paper, we propose an efficient and accurate arbitrary-shaped text detector, termed Pixel Aggregation Network (PAN), which is equipped with a low computational-cost segmentation head and a learnable post-processing. More specifically, the segmentation head is made up of Feature Pyramid Enhancement Module (FPEM) and Feature Fusion Module (FFM). FPEM is a cascadable U-shaped module, which can introduce multi-level information to guide the better segmentation. FFM can gather the features given by the FPEMs of different depths into a final feature for segmentation. The learnable post-processing is implemented by Pixel Aggregation (PA), which can precisely aggregate text pixels by predicted similarity vectors.

However, existing person re-identification methods are challenged by the ubiquitous occlusion over persons and suffer performance degradation. This paper proposes a novel occlusion-robust and alignment-free model for occluded person ReID and extends its application to realistic and crowded scenarios. The proposed model first leverages the fully convolution network (FCN) and pyramid pooling to extract spatial pyramid features. Then an alignment-free matching approach namely Foreground-aware Pyramid Reconstruction (FPR) is developed to accurately compute matching scores between occluded persons, regardless of their different scales and sizes. FPR uses the error from robust reconstruction over spatial pyramid features to measure similarities between two persons. More importantly, we design a occlusion-sensitive foreground probability generator that focuses more on clean human body parts to robustify the similarity computation with less contamination from occlusion. The FPR is easily embedded into any end-to-end person ReID models. The effectiveness of the proposed method is clearly demonstrated by the experimental results (Rank-1 accuracy) on three occluded person datasets: Partial REID (78.30%), Partial iLIDS (68.08%), Occluded REID (81.00%), and three benchmark person datasets: Market1501 (95.42%), DukeMTMC (88.64%), CUHK03 (76.08%).",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/He_Foreground-Aware_Pyramid_Reconstruction_for_Alignment-Free_Occluded_Person_Re-Identification_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

However, directly calculating the distances between the query image and support image in existing methods may cause ambiguity because dominant objects can locate anywhere on images. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Semantic Alignment Metric Learning (SAML) method for few-shot learning that aligns the semantically relevant dominant objects through a ""collect-and-select"" strategy. Specifically, we first calculate a relation matrix (RM) to ""collect"" the distances of each local region pairs of the 3D tensor extracted from a query image and the mean tensor of the support images. Then, the attention technique is adapted to ""select"" the semantically relevant pairs and put more weights on them. Afterwards, a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) is utilized to map the reweighted RMs to their corresponding similarity scores. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the generalization ability of SAML and gives a theoretical guarantee. Empirical results demonstrate that semantic alignment is achieved.

This conditioning is performed through a novel routing algorithm for attention-based efficient capsule selection. We address two challenging issues in video object segmentation: 1) segmentation of small objects and 2) occlusion of objects across time. The issue of segmenting small objects is addressed with a zooming module which allows the network to process small spatial regions of the video. Apart from this, the framework utilizes a novel memory module based on recurrent networks which helps in tracking objects when they move out of frame or are occluded.

Miss Detection vs. False Alarm: Adversarial Learning for Small Object Segmentation in Infrared Images,"Huan Wang, Luping Zhou, Lei Wang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 8509-8518","A key challenge of infrared small object segmentation (ISOS) is to balance miss detection (MD) and false alarm (FA). This usually needs ""opposite"" strategies to suppress the two terms, and has not been well resolved in the literature. In this paper, we propose a deep adversarial learning framework to improve this situation. Departing from the tradition of jointly reducing MD and FA via a single objective, we decompose this difficult task into two sub-tasks handled by two models trained adversarially, with each focusing on reducing either MD or FA. Such a new design brings forth at least three advantages. First, as each model focuses on a relatively simpler sub-task, the overall difficulty of ISOS is somehow decreased. Second, the adversarial training of the two models naturally produces a delicate balance of MD and FA, and low rates for both MD and FA could be achieved at Nash equilibrium. Third, this MD-FA detachment gives us more flexibility to develop specific models dedicated to each sub-task. To realize the above design, we propose a conditional Generative Adversarial Network comprising of two generators and one discriminator. Each generator strives for one sub-task, while the discriminator differentiates the three segmentation results from the two generators and the ground truth. Moreover, in order to better serve the sub-tasks, the two generators, based on context aggregation networks, utilzse different size of receptive fields, providing both local and global views of objects for segmentation. As verified on multiple infrared image data sets, our method consistently achieves better segmentation than many state-of-the-art ISOS methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Wang_Miss_Detection_vs._False_Alarm_Adversarial_Learning_for_Small_Object_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

Prior arts in the field struggle to reconstruct an accurate and scalable 3D model due to either the inefficient and expensive 3D representations, the dependency between the output and number of model parameters or the lack of a suitable computing operation. We propose to overcome these by deforming a random point cloud to the object shape through two steps: feature blending and deformation. In the first step, the global and point-specific shape features extracted from a 2D object image are blended with the encoded feature of a randomly generated point cloud, and then this mixture is sent to the deformation step to produce the final representative point set of the object. In the deformation process, we introduce a new layer termed as GraphX that considers the inter-relationship between points like common graph convolutions but operates on unordered sets. Moreover, with a simple trick, the proposed model can generate an arbitrary-sized point cloud, which is the first deep method to do so.

Given a novel image or video, our model infers a spatial hotspot map indicating where an object would be manipulated in a potential interaction even if the object is currently at rest. Through results with both first and third person video, we show the value of grounding affordances in real human-object interactions.

The standard way of looking at this problem is to formulate it as a super-resolution task, i.e., the source image is upsampled to the target resolution, while transferring the missing high-frequency details from the guide. Here, we propose to turn that interpretation on its head and instead see it as a pixel-to-pixel mapping of the guide image to the domain of the source image. The pixel-wise mapping is parametrised as a multi-layer perceptron, whose weights are learned by minimising the discrepancies between the source image and the downsampled target image. Importantly, our formulation makes it possible to regularise only the mapping function, while avoiding regularisation of the outputs; thus producing crisp, natural-looking images. The proposed method is unsupervised, using only the specific source and guide images to fit the mapping.

To the best of our knowledge, this is to date the largest light field dataset in which the dataset provides 1465 all-focus images with human-labeled ground truth masks and the corresponding focal stacks for every light field image. To verify the effectiveness of the light field data, we first introduce a fusion framework which includes two CNN streams where the focal stacks and all-focus images serve as the input. The focal stack stream utilizes a recurrent attention mechanism to adaptively learn to integrate every slice in the focal stack, which benefits from the extracted features of the good slices. Then it is incorporated with the output map generated by the all-focus stream to make the saliency prediction. In addition, we introduce adversarial examples by adding noise intentionally into images to help train the deep network, which can improve the robustness of the proposed network. The noise is designed by users, which is imperceptible but can fool the CNNs to make the wrong prediction. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed model on the popular evaluation metrics. The proposed method performs favorably compared with the existing 2D, 3D and 4D saliency detection methods on the proposed dataset and existing LFSD light field dataset.

Optimizing the F-Measure for Threshold-Free Salient Object Detection,"Kai Zhao, Shanghua Gao, Wenguan Wang, Ming-Ming Cheng"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 8849-8857","Current CNN-based solutions to salient object detection (SOD) mainly rely on the optimization of cross-entropy loss (CELoss). Then the quality of detected saliency maps is often evaluated in terms of F-measure. In this paper, we investigate an interesting issue: can we consistently use the F-measure formulation in both training and evaluation for SOD? By reformulating the standard F-measure we propose the relaxed F-measure which is differentiable w.r.t the posterior and can be easily appended to the back of CNNs as the loss function. Compared to the conventional cross-entropy loss of which the gradients decrease dramatically in the saturated area, our loss function, named FLoss, holds considerable gradients even when the activation approaches the target. Consequently, the FLoss can continuously force the network to produce polarized activations. Comprehensive benchmarks on several popular datasets show that FLoss outperforms the state-of-the-art with a considerable margin. More specifically, due to the polarized predictions, our method is able to obtain high-quality saliency maps without carefully tuning the optimal threshold, showing significant advantages in real-world applications.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Zhao_Optimizing_the_F-Measure_for_Threshold-Free_Salient_Object_Detection_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

Joint Optimization for Cooperative Image Captioning,"Gilad Vered, Gal Oren, Yuval Atzmon, Gal Chechik"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 8898-8907","When describing images with natural language, descriptions can be made more informative if tuned for downstream tasks. This can be achieved by training two networks: a ""speaker"" that generates sentences given an image and a ""listener"" that uses them to perform a task. Unfortunately, training multiple networks jointly to communicate, faces two major challenges. First, the descriptions generated by a speaker network are discrete and stochastic, making optimization very hard and inefficient. Second, joint training usually causes the vocabulary used during communication to drift and diverge from natural language. To address these challenges, we present an effective optimization technique based on partial-sampling from a multinomial distribution combined with straight-through gradient updates, which we name PSST for Partial-Sampling Straight-Through. We then show that the generated descriptions can be kept close to natural by constraining them to be similar to human descriptions. Together, this approach creates descriptions that are both more discriminative and more natural than previous approaches. Evaluations on the COCO benchmark show that PSST improve the recall@10 from 60% to 86% maintaining comparable language naturalness.

Recent progress in video captioning has been achieved through visual perception, but syntax representation learning is still under-explored. We propose a novel video captioning approach that takes into account both visual perception and syntax representation learning to generate accurate descriptions of videos. Specifically, we use sentence templates composed of Part-of-Speech (POS) tags to represent the syntax structure of captions, and accordingly, syntax representation learning is performed by directly inferring POS tags from videos. The visual perception is implemented by a mixture model which translates visual cues into lexical words that are conditional on the learned syntactic structure of sentences. Thus, a video captioning task consists of two sub-tasks: video POS tagging and visual cue translation, which are jointly modeled and trained in an end-to-end fashion.

This phenomenon is known as the semantic gap between vision and language. This problem can be overcome by providing semantic attributes that are homologous to language. Thanks to the inherent recurrent nature and gated operating mechanism, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and its variants are the dominating architectures in image captioning. However, when designing elaborate attention mechanisms to integrate visual inputs and semantic attributes, RNN-like variants become unflexible due to their complexities. In this paper, we investigate a Transformer-based sequence modeling framework, built only with attention layers and feedforward layers. To bridge the semantic gap, we introduce EnTangled Attention (ETA) that enables the Transformer to exploit semantic and visual information simultaneously.

We first build a large scale, carefully controlled dataset of human utterances each of which refers to a 2D rendering of a 3D CAD model so as to distinguish it from a set of shape-wise similar alternatives. Using this dataset, we develop neural language understanding (listening) and production (speaking) models that vary in their grounding (pure 3D forms via point-clouds vs. rendered 2D images), the degree of pragmatic reasoning captured (e.g. speakers that reason about a listener or not), and the neural architecture (e.g. with or without attention). We find models that perform well with both synthetic and human partners, and with held out utterances and objects. We also find that these models are capable of zero-shot transfer learning to novel object classes (e.g. transfer from training on chairs to testing on lamps), as well as to real-world images drawn from furniture catalogs. Lesion studies indicate that the neural listeners depend heavily on part-related words and associate these words correctly with visual parts of objects (without any explicit supervision on such parts), and that transfer to novel classes is most successful when known part-related words are available.

Existing virtual try-on methods can only transfer clothes given a fixed human pose, and still show unsatisfactory performances, often failing to preserve person identity or texture details, and with limited pose diversity. This paper makes the first attempt towards a multi-pose guided virtual try-on system, which enables clothes to transfer onto a person with diverse poses. Given an input person image, a desired clothes image, and a desired pose, the proposed Multi-pose Guided Virtual Try-On Network (MG-VTON) generates a new person image after fitting the desired clothes into the person and manipulating the pose. MG-VTON is constructed with three stages: 1) a conditional human parsing network is proposed that matches both the desired pose and the desired clothes shape; 2) a deep Warping Generative Adversarial Network (Warp-GAN) that warps the desired clothes appearance into the synthesized human parsing map and alleviates the misalignment problem between the input human pose and the desired one; 3) a refinement render network recovers the texture details of clothes and removes artifacts, based on multi-pose composition masks.

The discriminator is based on an auxiliary classifier GAN to classify the tag information as well as genuineness. In addition, we propose a novel network structure called SECat, which makes the generator properly colorize even small features such as eyes, and also suggest a novel two-step training method where the generator and discriminator first learn the notion of object and shape and then, based on the learned notion, learn colorization, such as where and how to place which color.

In order to leverage architectures in 2D detectors, they often convert 3D point clouds to regular grids (i.e., to voxel grids or to bird's eye view images), or rely on detection in 2D images to propose 3D boxes. Few works have attempted to directly detect objects in point clouds. In this work, we return to first principles to construct a 3D detection pipeline for point cloud data and as generic as possible. However, due to the sparse nature of the data -- samples from 2D manifolds in 3D space -- we face a major challenge when directly predicting bounding box parameters from scene points: a 3D object centroid can be far from any surface point thus hard to regress accurately in one step. To address the challenge, we propose VoteNet, an end-to-end 3D object detection network based on a synergy of deep point set networks and Hough voting.

Learning Trajectory Dependencies for Human Motion Prediction,"Wei Mao, Miaomiao Liu, Mathieu Salzmann, Hongdong Li"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 9489-9497","Human motion prediction, i.e., forecasting future body poses given observed pose sequence, has typically been tackled with recurrent neural networks (RNNs). However, as evidenced by prior work, the resulted RNN models suffer from prediction errors accumulation, leading to undesired discontinuities in motion prediction. In this paper, we propose a simple feed-forward deep network for motion prediction, which takes into account both temporal smoothness and spatial dependencies among human body joints. In this context, we then propose to encode temporal information by working in trajectory space, instead of the traditionally-used pose space. This alleviates us from manually defining the range of temporal dependencies (or temporal convolutional filter size, as done in previous work). Moreover, spatial dependency of human pose is encoded by treating a human pose as a generic graph (rather than a human skeletal kinematic tree) formed by links between every pair of body joints. Instead of using a pre-defined graph structure, we design a new graph convolutional network to learn graph connectivity automatically.

To address this problem, we build an animal pose dataset to facilitate training and evaluation. Considering the heavy labor needed to label dataset and it is impossible to label data for all concerned animal species, we, therefore, proposed a novel cross-domain adaptation method to transform the animal pose knowledge from labeled animal classes to unlabeled animal classes. We use the modest animal pose dataset to adapt learned knowledge to multiple animals species. Moreover, humans also share skeleton similarities with some animals (especially four-footed mammals). Therefore, the easily available human pose dataset, which is of a much larger scale than our labeled animal dataset, provides important prior knowledge to boost up the performance on animal pose estimation.

NOTE-RCNN: NOise Tolerant Ensemble RCNN for Semi-Supervised Object Detection,"Jiyang Gao, Jiang Wang, Shengyang Dai, Li-Jia Li, Ram Nevatia"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 9508-9517","The labeling cost of large number of bounding boxes is one of the main challenges for training modern object detectors. To reduce the dependence on expensive bounding box annotations, we propose a new semi-supervised object detection formulation, in which a few seed box level annotations and a large scale of image level annotations are used to train the detector. We adopt a training-mining framework, which is widely used in weakly supervised object detection tasks. However, the mining process inherently introduces various kinds of labelling noises: false negatives, false positives and inaccurate boundaries, which can be harmful for training the standard object detectors (e.g. Faster RCNN). We propose a novel NOise Tolerant Ensemble RCNN (NOTE-RCNN) object detector to handle such noisy labels. Comparing to standard Faster RCNN, it contains three highlights: an ensemble of two classification heads and a distillation head to avoid overfitting on noisy labels and improve the mining precision, masking the negative sample loss in box predictor to avoid the harm of false negative labels, and training box regression head only on seed annotations to eliminate the harm from inaccurate boundaries of mined bounding boxes. We evaluate the methods on ILSVRC 2013 and MSCOCO 2017 dataset; we observe that the detection accuracy consistently improves as we iterate between mining and training steps, and state-of-the-art performance is achieved.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Gao_NOTE-RCNN_NOise_Tolerant_Ensemble_RCNN_for_Semi-Supervised_Object_Detection_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

In each training episode, an episodic class mean computed from a support set is registered with the global representation via a registration module. This produces a registered global class representation for computing the classification loss using a query set. Though following a similar episodic training pipeline as existing meta learning based approaches, our method differs significantly in that novel class training samples are involved in the training from the beginning. To compensate for the lack of novel class training samples, an effective sample synthesis strategy is developed to avoid overfitting. Importantly, by joint base-novel class training, our approach can be easily extended to a more practical yet challenging FSL setting, i.e., generalized FSL, where the label space of test data is extended to both base and novel classes.

One way to alleviate this issue is to enhance the features of small RoIs using a super-resolution (SR) technique. We investigate how to improve feature-level super-resolution especially for small object detection, and discover its performance can be significantly improved by (i) utilizing proper high-resolution target features as supervision signals for training of a SR model and (ii) matching the relative receptive fields of training pairs of input low-resolution features and target high-resolution features. We propose a novel feature-level super-resolution approach that not only correctly addresses these two desiderata but also is integrable with any proposal-based detectors with feature pooling. In our experiments, our approach significantly improves the performance of Faster R-CNN on three benchmarks of Tsinghua-Tencent 100K, PASCAL VOC and MS COCO. The improvement for small objects is remarkably large, and encouragingly, those for medium and large objects are nontrivial too.

AutoFocus: Efficient Multi-Scale Inference,"Mahyar Najibi, Bharat Singh, Larry S. Davis"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 9745-9755","This paper describes AutoFocus, an efficient multi-scale inference algorithm for deep-learning based object detectors. Instead of processing an entire image pyramid, AutoFocus adopts a coarse to fine approach and only processes regions which are likely to contain small objects at finer scales. This is achieved by predicting category agnostic segmentation maps for small objects at coarser scales, called FocusPixels. FocusPixels can be predicted with high recall, and in many cases, they only cover a small fraction of the entire image. To make efficient use of FocusPixels, an algorithm is proposed which generates compact rectangular FocusChips which enclose FocusPixels. The detector is only applied inside FocusChips, which reduces computation while processing finer scales. Different types of error can arise when detections from FocusChips of multiple scales are combined, hence techniques to correct them are proposed. AutoFocus obtains an mAP of 47.9% (68.3% at 50% overlap) on the COCO test-dev set while processing 6.4 images per second on a Titan X (Pascal) GPU. This is 2.5X faster than our multi-scale baseline detector and matches its mAP. The number of pixels processed in the pyramid can be reduced by 5X with a 1% drop in mAP.

Cluster Alignment With a Teacher for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Zhijie Deng, Yucen Luo, Jun Zhu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 9944-9953","Deep learning methods have shown promise in unsupervised domain adaptation, which aims to leverage a labeled source domain to learn a classifier for the unlabeled target domain with a different distribution.

In this paper, we propose Cluster Alignment with a Teacher (CAT) for unsupervised domain adaptation, which can effectively incorporate the discriminative clustering structures in both domains for better adaptation. Technically, CAT leverages an implicit ensembling teacher model to reliably discover the class-conditional structure in the feature space for the unlabeled target domain. Then CAT forces the features of both the source and the target domains to form discriminative class-conditional clusters and aligns the corresponding clusters across domains.

However, due to the nontrivial difficulty of generating a feasible mesh structure, the state-of-the-art approaches often simplify the problem by learning the displacements of a template mesh that deforms it to the target surface. Though reconstructing a 3D shape with complex topology can be achieved by deforming multiple mesh patches, it remains difficult to stitch the results to ensure a high meshing quality. In this paper, we present an end-to-end single-view mesh reconstruction framework that is able to generate high-quality meshes with complex topologies from a single genus-0 template mesh. The key to our approach is a novel progressive shaping framework that alternates between mesh deformation and topology modification. While a deformation network predicts the per-vertex translations that reduce the gap between the reconstructed mesh and the ground truth, a novel topology modification network is employed to prune the error-prone faces, enabling the evolution of topology. By iterating over the two procedures, one can progressively modify the mesh topology while achieving higher reconstruction accuracy. Moreover, a boundary refinement network is designed to refine the boundary conditions to further improve the visual quality of the reconstructed mesh.

First of all, the generated heatmaps translate to the locations of landmarks (i.e. confidence maps) from which predicted landmark locations (i.e. the means) get penalized without accounting for the spread: a high- scatter corresponds to low confidence and vice-versa. For this, we introduce a LaplaceKL objective that penalizes for low confidence. Another issue is a dependency on labeled data, which are expensive to obtain and susceptible to error.

Deep Head Pose Estimation Using Synthetic Images and Partial Adversarial Domain Adaption for Continuous Label Spaces,"Felix Kuhnke, Jorn Ostermann"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 10164-10173","Head pose estimation aims at predicting an accurate pose from an image. Current approaches rely on supervised deep learning, which typically requires large amounts of labeled data. Manual or sensor-based annotations of head poses are prone to errors. A solution is to generate synthetic training data by rendering 3D face models. However, the differences (domain gap) between rendered (source-domain) and real-world (target-domain) images can cause low performance. Advances in visual domain adaptation allow reducing the influence of domain differences using adversarial neural networks, which match the feature spaces between domains by enforcing domain-invariant features. While previous work on visual domain adaptation generally assumes discrete and shared label spaces, these assumptions are both invalid for pose estimation tasks. We are the first to present domain adaptation for head pose estimation with a focus on partially shared and continuous label spaces.

However, as opposed to traditional broad-band filters, which often absorb unwanted light, narrow band-pass interference filters reflect non-transmitted light. This is a source of very significant flare which biases hyperspectral measurements. The bias in any pixel depends on spectral content in other pixels.

Deep learning techniques on the other hand are purely data-driven, often provide excellent results, but are very difficult to constrain to predefined physical or safety-critical models. A possible combination between the two approaches is to design a parametric energy and train the free parameters in such a way that minimizers of the energy correspond to desired solution on a set of training examples. Unfortunately, such formulations typically lead to bi-level optimization problems, on which common optimization algorithms are difficult to scale to modern requirements in data processing and efficiency. In this work, we present a new strategy to optimize these bi-level problems.

However, using a full validation set can be computationally expensive. In this work, we develop a general Bayesian optimization framework for optimizing functions that are computed based on U-statistics. We propagate Gaussian uncertainties from the statistics through the Bayesian optimization framework yielding a method that gives a probabilistic approximation certificate of the result. We then apply this to parameter selection in neural network compression. Compression objectives that can be written as U-statistics are typically based on empirical risk and knowledge distillation for deep discriminative models.

It generally produces very accurate results; however, the reconstructed model often lacks completeness, especially in correspondence of broad untextured areas where the photo-consistency metrics are unreliable. Assuming the untextured areas piecewise planar, in this paper we generate novel PatchMatch hypotheses so to expand reliable depth estimates in neighboring untextured regions. At the same time, we modify the photo-consistency measure such to favor standard or novel PatchMatch depth hypotheses depending on the textureness of the considered area. We also propose a depth refinement step to filter wrong estimates and to fill the gaps on both the depth maps and normal maps while preserving the discontinuities.

Recent deep learning based methods depend on learning global geometry from self-reconstruction. However, these methods are still suffering from ineffective learning of local geometry, which significantly limits the discriminability of learned features. To resolve this issue, we propose MAP-VAE to enable the learning of global and local geometry by jointly leveraging global and local self-supervision. To enable effective local self-supervision, we introduce multi-angle analysis for point clouds. In a multi-angle scenario, we first split a point cloud into a front half and a back half from each angle, and then, train MAP-VAE to learn to predict a back half sequence from the corresponding front half sequence. MAP-VAE performs this half-to-half prediction using RNN to simultaneously learn each local geometry and the spatial relationship among them. In addition, MAP-VAE also learns global geometry via self-reconstruction, where we employ a variational constraint to facilitate novel shape generation.

In this paper, we propose a Contrast Induced Attention Network (CIA-Net), which exploits the highly structured property of chest X-ray images and localizes diseases via contrastive learning on the aligned positive and negative samples. To force the attention module to focus only on sites of abnormalities, we also introduce a learnable alignment module to adjust all the input images, which eliminates variations of scales, angles, and displacements of X-ray images generated under bad scan conditions. We show that the use of contrastive attention and alignment module allows the model to learn rich identification and localization information using only a small amount of location annotations, resulting in state-of-the-art performance in NIH chest X-ray dataset.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Liu_Align_Attend_and_Locate_Chest_X-Ray_Diagnosis_via_Contrast_Induced_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv
Joint Acne Image Grading and Counting via Label Distribution Learning,"Xiaoping Wu, Ni Wen, Jie Liang, Yu-Kun Lai, Dongyu She, Ming-Ming Cheng, Jufeng Yang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 10642-10651","Accurate grading of skin disease severity plays a crucial role in precise treatment for patients. Acne vulgaris, the most common skin disease in adolescence, can be graded by evidence-based lesion counting as well as experience-based global estimation in the medical field. However, due to the appearance similarity of acne with close severity, it is challenging to count and grade acne accurately. In this paper, we address the problem of acne image analysis via Label Distribution Learning (LDL) considering the ambiguous information among acne severity. Based on the professional grading criterion, we generate two acne label distributions considering the relationship between the similar number of lesions and severity of acne, respectively. We also propose a unified framework for joint acne image grading and counting, which is optimized by the multi-task learning loss. In addition, we further build the ACNE04 dataset with annotations of acne severity and lesion number of each image for evaluation. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

An Alarm System for Segmentation Algorithm Based on Shape Model,"Fengze Liu, Yingda Xia, Dong Yang, Alan L. Yuille, Daguang Xu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 10652-10661","It is usually hard for a learning system to predict correctly on rare events that never occur in the training data, and there is no exception for segmentation algorithms. Meanwhile, manual inspection of each case to locate the failures becomes infeasible due to the trend of large data scale and limited human resource. Therefore, we build an alarm system that will set off alerts when the segmentation result is possibly unsatisfactory, assuming no corresponding ground truth mask is provided. One plausible solution is to project the segmentation results into a low dimensional feature space; then learn classifiers/regressors to predict their qualities. Motivated by this, in this paper, we learn a feature space using the shape information which is a strong prior shared among different datasets and robust to the appearance variation of input data. The shape feature is captured using a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) network that trained with only the ground truth masks. During testing, the segmentation results with bad shapes shall not fit the shape prior well, resulting in large loss values. Thus, the VAE is able to evaluate the quality of segmentation result on unseen data, without using ground truth. Finally, we learn a regressor in the one-dimensional feature space to predict the qualities of segmentation results. Our alarm system is evaluated on several recent state-of-art segmentation algorithms for 3D medical segmentation tasks. Compared with other standard quality assessment methods, our system consistently provides more reliable prediction on the qualities of segmentation results.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Liu_An_Alarm_System_for_Segmentation_Algorithm_Based_on_Shape_Model_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

Screening for ROIs is a tedious and time-consuming visual recognition task which can be exhausting. The cognitive workload could be reduced by developing a visual aid to narrow down the visual search area by highlighting (or segmenting) regions of diagnostic relevance, enabling pathologists to spend more time diagnosing relevant ROIs. In this paper, we propose HistoSegNet, a method for semantic segmentation of histological tissue type (HTT). Using the HTT-annotated Atlas of Digital Pathology (ADP) database, we train a Convolutional Neural Network on the patch annotations, infer Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps, average overlapping predictions, and post-process the segmentation with a fully-connected Conditional Random Field.

Yuille"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2019, pp. 10672-10681","Accurate multi-organ abdominal CT segmentation is essential to many clinical applications such as computer-aided intervention. As data annotation requires massive human labor from experienced radiologists, it is common that training data is usually partially-labeled. However, these background labels can be misleading in multi-organ segmentation since the ""background"" usually contains some other organs of interest. To address the background ambiguity in these partially-labeled datasets, we propose Prior-aware Neural Network (PaNN) via explicitly incorporating anatomical priors on abdominal organ sizes, guiding the training process with domain-specific knowledge. More specifically, PaNN assumes that the average organ size distributions in the abdomen should approximate their empirical distributions, a prior statistics obtained from the fully-labeled dataset. As our objective is difficult to be directly optimized using stochastic gradient descent, it is reformulated as a min-max form and optimized via the stochastic primal-dual gradient algorithm. PaNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MICCAI2015 challenge ""Multi-Atlas Labeling Beyond the Cranial Vault"", a competition on organ segmentation in the abdomen. We report an average Dice score of 84.97%, surpassing the prior art by a large margin of 3.27%.

In this research, we propose CAMEL, a weakly supervised learning framework for histopathology image segmentation using only image-level labels. Using multiple instance learning (MIL)-based label enrichment, CAMEL splits the image into latticed instances and automatically generates instance-level labels. After label enrichment, the instance-level labels are further assigned to the corresponding pixels, producing the approximate pixel-level labels and making fully supervised training of segmentation models possible. CAMEL achieves comparable performance with the fully supervised approaches in both instance-level classification and pixel-level segmentation on CAMELYON16 and a colorectal adenoma dataset. Moreover, the generality of the automatic labeling methodology may benefit future weakly supervised learning studies for histopathology image analysis.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Xu_CAMEL_A_Weakly_Supervised_Learning_Framework_for_Histopathology_Image_Segmentation_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

Longitudinal image acquisitions are common in various scientific and biomedical studies where often each image sequence sample may also come together with various secondary (fixed or temporally dependent) measurements. The key goal is not only to estimate the parameters of a deep generative model for the given longitudinal data, but also to enable evaluation of how the temporal course of the generated longitudinal samples are influenced as a function of induced changes in the (secondary) temporal measurements (or events). Our proposed formulation incorporates recurrent subnetworks and temporal context gating, which provides a smooth transition in a temporal sequence of generated data that can be easily informed or modulated by secondary temporal conditioning variables. We show that the formulation works well despite the smaller sample sizes common in these applications. Our model is validated on two video datasets and a longitudinal Alzheimer's disease (AD) dataset for both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated samples. Further, using our generated longitudinal image samples, we show that we can capture the pathological progressions in the brain that turn out to be consistent with the existing literature, and could facilitate various types of downstream statistical analysis.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Hwang_Conditional_Recurrent_Flow_Conditional_Generation_of_Longitudinal_Samples_With_Applications_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

However, it is challenging to train CNN on whole slide images (WSIs) of gigapixel resolution considering the available memory capacity. Most of the previous works divide high resolution WSIs into small image patches and separately input them into the model to classify it as a tumor or a normal tissue. However, patch-based classification uses only patch-scale local information but ignores the relationship between neighboring patches. If we consider the relationship of neighboring patches and global features, we can improve the classification performance. In this paper, we propose a new model structure combining the patch-based classification model and whole slide-scale segmentation model in order to improve the prediction performance of automatic pathological diagnosis. We extract patch features from the classification model and input them into the segmentation model to obtain a whole slide tumor probability heatmap. The classification model considers patch-scale local features, and the segmentation model can take global information into account. We also propose a new optimization method that retains gradient information and trains the model partially for end-to-end learning with limited GPU memory capacity. We apply our method to the tumor/normal prediction on WSIs and the classification performance is improved compared with the conventional patch-based method.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_ICCV_2019/html/Takahama_Multi-Stage_Pathological_Image_Classification_Using_Semantic_Segmentation_ICCV_2019_paper.html,2019,iccv

However, 1) most existing models rely on effective constraints to explore the internal representation of lesions, which only produces inaccurate and coarse lesions regions; 2) they ignore the strong probabilistic dependencies between target lesions dataset (e.g., enteroscopy images) and well-to-annotated source diseases dataset (e.g., gastroscope images). To better utilize these dependencies, we present a new semantic lesions representation transfer model for weakly-supervised endoscopic lesions segmentation, which can exploit useful knowledge from relevant fully-labeled diseases segmentation task to enhance the performance of target weakly-labeled lesions segmentation task. More specifically, a pseudo label generator is proposed to leverage seed information to generate highly-confident pseudo pixel labels by incorporating class balance and super-pixel spatial prior. It can iteratively include more hard-to-transfer samples from weakly-labeled target dataset into training set. Afterwards, dynamically-searched feature centroids for same class among different datasets are aligned by accumulating previously-learned features. Meanwhile, adversarial learning is also employed in this paper, to narrow the gap between the lesions among different datasets in output space. Finally, we build a new medical endoscopic dataset with 3659 images collected from more than 1100 volunteers.
