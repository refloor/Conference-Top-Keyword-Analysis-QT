Invertible Denoising Network: A Light Solution for Real Noise Removal,"Yang Liu, Zhenyue Qin, Saeed Anwar, Pan Ji, Dongwoo Kim, Sabrina Caldwell, Tom Gedeon"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 13365-13374","Invertible networks have various benefits for image denoising since they are lightweight, information-lossless, and memory-saving during back-propagation. However, applying invertible models to remove noise is challenging because the input is noisy, and the reversed output is clean, following two different distributions. We propose an invertible denoising network, InvDN, to address this challenge. InvDN transforms the noisy input into a low-resolution clean image and a latent representation containing noise. To discard noise and restore the clean image, InvDN replaces the noisy latent representation with another one sampled from a prior distribution during reversion. The denoising performance of InvDN is better than all the existing competitive models, achieving a new state-of-the-art result for the SIDD dataset while enjoying less run time. Moreover, the size of InvDN is far smaller, only having 4.2% of the number of parameters compared to the most recently proposed DANet. Further, via manipulating the noisy latent representation, InvDN is also able to generate noise more similar to the original one.

Greedy Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders for Large-Scale Video Prediction,"Bohan Wu, Suraj Nair, Roberto Martin-Martin, Li Fei-Fei, Chelsea Finn"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 2318-2328","A video prediction model that generalizes to diverse scenes would enable intelligent agents such as robots to perform a variety of tasks via planning with the model. However, while existing video prediction models have produced promising results on small datasets, they suffer from severe underfitting when trained on large and diverse datasets. To address this underfitting challenge, we first observe that the ability to train larger video prediction models is often bottlenecked by the memory constraints of GPUs or TPUs. In parallel, deep hierarchical latent variable models can produce higher quality predictions by capturing the multi-level stochasticity of future observations, but end-to-end optimization of such models is notably difficult. Our key insight is that greedy and modular optimization of hierarchical autoencoders can simultaneously address both the memory constraints and the optimization challenges of large-scale video prediction. We introduce Greedy Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders (GHVAEs), a method that learns high-fidelity video predictions by greedily training each level of a hierarchical autoencoder. In comparison to state-of-the-art models, GHVAEs provide 17-55% gains in prediction performance on four video datasets, a 35-40% higher success rate on real robot tasks, and can improve performance monotonically by simply adding more modules.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Wu_Greedy_Hierarchical_Variational_Autoencoders_for_Large-Scale_Video_Prediction_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Over-the-Air Adversarial Flickering Attacks Against Video Recognition Networks,"Roi Pony, Itay Naeh, Shie Mannor"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 515-524","Deep neural networks for video classification, just like image classification networks, may be subjected to adversarial manipulation. The main difference between image classifiers and video classifiers is that the latter usually use temporal information contained within the video. In this work we present a manipulation scheme for fooling video classifiers by introducing a flickering temporal perturbation that in some cases may be unnoticeable by human observers and is implementable in the real world. After demonstrating the manipulation of action classification of single videos, we generalize the procedure to make universal adversarial perturbation, achieving high fooling ratio. In addition, we generalize the universal perturbation and produce a temporal-invariant perturbation, which can be applied to the video without synchronizing the perturbation to the input. The attack was implemented on several target models and the transferability of the attack was demonstrated. These properties allow us to bridge the gap between simulated environment and real-world application, as will be demonstrated in this paper for the first time for an over-the-air flickering attack.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Pony_Over-the-Air_Adversarial_Flickering_Attacks_Against_Video_Recognition_Networks_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Encoder Fusion Network With Co-Attention Embedding for Referring Image Segmentation,"Guang Feng, Zhiwei Hu, Lihe Zhang, Huchuan Lu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 15506-15515","Recently, referring image segmentation has aroused widespread interest. Previous methods perform the multi-modal fusion between language and vision at the decoding side of the network. And, linguistic feature interacts with visual feature of each scale separately, which ignores the continuous guidance of language to multi-scale visual features. In this work, we propose an encoder fusion network (EFN), which transforms the visual encoder into a multi-modal feature learning network, and uses language to refine the multi-modal features progressively. Moreover, a co-attention mechanism is embedded in the EFN to realize the parallel update of multi-modal features, which can promote the consistent of the cross-modal information representation in the semantic space. Finally, we propose a boundary enhancement module (BEM) to make the network pay more attention to the fine structure.

Polka Lines: Learning Structured Illumination and Reconstruction for Active Stereo,"Seung-Hwan Baek, Felix Heide"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 5757-5767","Active stereo cameras that recover depth from structured light captures have become a cornerstone sensor modality for 3D scene reconstruction and understanding tasks across application domains. Active stereo cameras project a pseudo-random dot pattern on object surfaces to extract disparity independently of object texture. Such hand-crafted patterns are designed in isolation from the scene statistics, ambient illumination conditions, and the reconstruction method. In this work, we propose a method to jointly learn structured illumination and reconstruction, parameterized by a diffractive optical element and a neural network, in an end-to-end fashion. To this end, we introduce a differentiable image formation model for active stereo, relying on both wave and geometric optics, and a trinocular reconstruction network. The jointly optimized pattern, which we dub ""Polka Lines,"" together with the reconstruction network, makes accurate active-stereo depth estimates across imaging conditions. We validate the proposed method in simulation and using with an experimental prototype, and we demonstrate several variants of the Polka Lines patterns specialized to the illumination conditions.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Baek_Polka_Lines_Learning_Structured_Illumination_and_Reconstruction_for_Active_Stereo_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Image Inpainting With External-Internal Learning and Monochromic Bottleneck,"Tengfei Wang, Hao Ouyang, Qifeng Chen"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 5120-5129","Although recent inpainting approaches have demonstrated significant improvement with deep neural networks, they still suffer from artifacts such as blunt structures and abrupt colors when filling in the missing regions. To address these issues, we propose an external-internal inpainting scheme with a monochromic bottleneck that helps image inpainting models remove these artifacts. In the external learning stage, we reconstruct missing structures and details in the monochromic space to reduce the learning dimension. In the internal learning stage, we propose a novel internal color propagation method with progressive learning strategies for consistent color restoration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed scheme helps image inpainting models produce more structure-preserved and visually compelling results.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Wang_Image_Inpainting_With_External-Internal_Learning_and_Monochromic_Bottleneck_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Patch2Pix: Epipolar-Guided Pixel-Level Correspondences,"Qunjie Zhou, Torsten Sattler, Laura Leal-Taixe"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 4669-4678","The classical matching pipeline used for visual localization typically involves three steps: (i) local feature detection and description, (ii) feature matching, and (iii) outlier rejection. Recently emerged correspondence networks propose to perform those steps inside a single network but suffer from low matching resolution due to the memory bottleneck. In this work, we propose a new perspective to estimate correspondences in a detect-to-refine manner, where we first predict patch-level match proposals and then refine them. We present Patch2Pix, a novel refinement network that refines match proposals by regressing pixel-level matches from the local regions defined by those proposals and jointly rejecting outlier matches with confidence scores. Patch2Pix is weakly supervised to learn correspondences that are consistent with the epipolar geometry of an input image pair. We show that our refinement network significantly improves the performance of correspondence networks on image matching, homography estimation, and localization tasks. In addition, we show that our learned refinement generalizes to fully-supervised methods without re-training, which leads us to state-of-the-art localization performance.

Diverse Part Discovery: Occluded Person Re-Identification With Part-Aware Transformer,"Yulin Li, Jianfeng He, Tianzhu Zhang, Xiang Liu, Yongdong Zhang, Feng Wu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 2898-2907","Occluded person re-identification (Re-ID) is a challenging task as persons are frequently occluded by various obstacles or other persons, especially in the crowd scenario. To address these issues, we propose a novel end-to-end Part-Aware Transformer (PAT) for occluded person Re-ID through diverse part discovery via a transformer encoder-decoder architecture, including a pixel context based transformer encoder and a part prototype based transformer decoder. The proposed PAT model enjoys several merits. First, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to exploit the transformer encoder-decoder architecture for occluded person Re-ID in a unified deep model. Second, to learn part prototypes well with only identity labels, we design two effective mechanisms including part diversity and part discriminability. Consequently, we can achieve diverse part discovery for occluded person Re-ID in a weakly supervised manner.

Counterfactual Zero-Shot and Open-Set Visual Recognition,"Zhongqi Yue, Tan Wang, Qianru Sun, Xian-Sheng Hua, Hanwang Zhang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 15404-15414","We present a novel counterfactual framework for both Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and Open-Set Recognition (OSR), whose common challenge is generalizing to the unseen-classes by only training on the seen-classes. Our idea stems from the observation that the generated samples for unseen-classes are often out of the true distribution, which causes severe recognition rate imbalance between the seen-class (high) and unseen-class (low). We show that the key reason is that the generation is not Counterfactual Faithful, and thus we propose a faithful one, whose generation is from the sample-specific counterfactual question: What would the sample look like, if we set its class attribute to a certain class, while keeping its sample attribute unchanged? Thanks to the faithfulness, we can apply the Consistency Rule to perform unseen/seen binary classification, by asking: Would its counterfactual still look like itself? If ""yes"", the sample is from a certain class, and ""no"" otherwise. Through extensive experiments on ZSL and OSR, we demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates the seen/unseen imbalance and hence significantly improves the overall performance. Note that this framework is orthogonal to existing methods, thus, it can serve as a new baseline to evaluate how ZSL/OSR models generalize.

However, these methods are still not reliable enough for real-world deployments, due to the insufficient generalization capability of the models learned on existing benchmarks that have limitations in multiple aspects, including limited data scale, capture condition variations, and appearance diversities. To this end, we collect a new dataset named Person30K with the following distinct features: 1) a very large scale containing 1.38 million images of 30K identities, 2) a large capture system containing 6,497 cameras deployed at 89 different sites, 3) abundant sample diversities including varied backgrounds and diverse person poses. Furthermore, we propose a domain generalization ReID method, dual-meta generalization network (DMG-Net), to exploit the merits of meta-learning in both the training procedure and the metric space learning.

Patch-NetVLAD: Multi-Scale Fusion of Locally-Global Descriptors for Place Recognition,"Stephen Hausler, Sourav Garg, Ming Xu, Michael Milford, Tobias Fischer"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 14141-14152","Visual Place Recognition is a challenging task for robotics and autonomous systems, which must deal with the twin problems of appearance and viewpoint change in an always changing world. This paper introduces Patch-NetVLAD, which provides a novel formulation for combining the advantages of both local and global descriptor methods by deriving patch-level features from NetVLAD residuals. Unlike the fixed spatial neighborhood regime of existing local keypoint features, our method enables aggregation and matching of deep-learned local features defined over the feature-space grid. We further introduce a multi-scale fusion of patch features that have complementary scales (i.e. patch sizes) via an integral feature space and show that the fused features are highly invariant to both condition (season, structure, and illumination) and viewpoint (translation and rotation) changes. Patch-NetVLAD achieves state-of-the-art visual place recognition results in computationally limited scenarios, validated on a range of challenging real-world datasets, including winning the Facebook Mapillary Visual Place Recognition Challenge at ECCV2020. It is also adaptable to user requirements, with a speed-optimised version operating over an order of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art. By combining superior performance with improved computational efficiency in a configurable framework, Patch-NetVLAD is well suited to enhance both stand-alone place recognition capabilities and the overall performance of SLAM systems.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Hausler_Patch-NetVLAD_Multi-Scale_Fusion_of_Locally-Global_Descriptors_for_Place_Recognition_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Recent research has explored generating stereophonic audios guided by visual cues and multi-channel audio collections in a fully-supervised manner. However, due to the requirement of professional recording devices, existing datasets are limited in scale and variety, which impedes the generalization of supervised methods to real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose PseudoBinaural, an effective pipeline that is free of binaural recordings. The key insight is to carefully build pseudo visual-stereo pairs with mono data for training. Specifically, we leverage spherical harmonic decomposition and head-related impulse response (HRIR) to identify the relationship between the location of a sound source and the received binaural audio. Then in the visual modality, corresponding visual cues of the mono data are manually placed at sound source positions to form the pairs. Compared to fully-supervised paradigms, our binaural-recording-free pipeline shows great stability in the cross-dataset evaluation and comparable performance under subjective preference. Moreover, combined with binaural recorded data, our method is able to further boost the performance of binaural audio generation under supervised settings.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Xu_Visually_Informed_Binaural_Audio_Generation_without_Binaural_Audios_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Our approach simultaneously recovers the intrinsic and extrinsic calibration of a camera from line-features only. This enables uncalibrated devices to both localize themselves within an existing map as well as contribute to the map, while preserving the privacy of the image contents.

Learning Calibrated Medical Image Segmentation via Multi-Rater Agreement Modeling,"Wei Ji, Shuang Yu, Junde Wu, Kai Ma, Cheng Bian, Qi Bi, Jingjing Li, Hanruo Liu, Li Cheng, Yefeng Zheng"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 12341-12351","In medical image analysis, it is typical to collect multiple annotations, each from a different clinical expert or rater, in the expectation that possible diagnostic errors could be mitigated. Meanwhile, from the computer vision practitioner viewpoint, it has been a common practice to adopt the ground-truth obtained via either the majority-vote or simply one annotation from a preferred rater. This process, however, tends to overlook the rich information of agreement or disagreement ingrained in the raw multi-rater annotations. To address this issue, we propose to explicitly model the multi-rater (dis-)agreement, dubbed MRNet, which has two main contributions. First, an expertise-aware inferring module or EIM is devised to embed the expertise level of individual raters as prior knowledge, to form high-level semantic features. Second, our approach is capable of reconstructing multi-rater gradings from coarse predictions, with the multi-rater (dis-)agreement cues being further exploited to improve the segmentation performance. To our knowledge, our work is the first in producing calibrated predictions under different expertise levels for medical image segmentation.

Contrastive Learning for Compact Single Image Dehazing,"Haiyan Wu, Yanyun Qu, Shaohui Lin, Jian Zhou, Ruizhi Qiao, Zhizhong Zhang, Yuan Xie, Lizhuang Ma"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 10551-10560","Single image dehazing is a challenging ill-posed problem due to the severe information degeneration. However, existing deep learning based dehazing methods only adopt clear images as positive samples to guide the training of dehazing network while negative information is unexploited. Moreover, most of them focus on strengthening the dehazing network with an increase of depth and width, leading to a significant requirement of computation and memory. In this paper, we propose a novel contrastive regularization (CR) built upon contrastive learning to exploit both the information of hazy images and clear images as negative and positive samples, respectively. CR ensures that the restored image is pulled to closer to the clear image and pushed to far away from the hazy image in the representation space. Furthermore, considering trade-off between performance and memory storage, we develop a compact dehazing network based on autoencoder-like (AE) framework. It involves an adaptive mixup operation and a dynamic feature enhancement module, which can benefit from preserving information flow adaptively and expanding the receptive field to improve the network's transformation capability, respectively.

These methods heavily rely on the region proposal mechanisms and ROI-based instance-level features to design fine-grained feature alignment modules with respect to the foreground objects. However, for one-stage detectors, it is hard or even impossible to obtain explicit instance-level features in the detection pipelines. Motivated by this, we propose an Implicit Instance-Invariant Network (I3Net), which is tailored for adapting one-stage detectors and implicitly learns instance-invariant features via exploiting the natural characteristics of deep features in different layers. Specifically, we facilitate the adaptation from three aspects: (1) Dynamic and Class-Balanced Reweighting (DCBR) strategy, which considers the coexistence of intra-domain and intra-class variations to assign larger weights to those sample-scarce categories and easy-to-adapt samples; (2) Category-aware Object Pattern Matching (COPM) module, which boosts the cross-domain foreground objects matching guided by the categorical information and suppresses the uninformative background features; (3) Regularized Joint Category Alignment (RJCA) module, which jointly enforces the category alignment at different domain-specific layers with a consistency regularization.

Existing methods are mostly two-stage based--one stage for person localization and the other stage for individual body mesh estimation, leading to redundant pipelines with high computation cost and degraded performance for complex scenes (e.g., occluded person instances). In this work, we present a single stage model, Body Meshes as Points (BMP), to simplify the pipeline and lift both efficiency and performance. In particular, BMP adopts a new method that represents multiple person instances as points in the spatial-depth space where each point is associated with one body mesh. Hinging on such representations, BMP can directly predict body meshes for multiple persons in a single stage by concurrently localizing person instance points and estimating the corresponding body meshes. To better reason about depth ordering of all the persons within the same scene, BMP designs a simple yet effective inter-instance ordinal depth loss to obtain depth-coherent body mesh estimation. BMP also introduces a novel keypoint-aware augmentation to enhance model robustness to occluded person instances. Comprehensive experiments on benchmarks Panoptic, MuPoTS-3D and 3DPW clearly demonstrate the state-of-the-art efficiency of BMP for multi-person body mesh estimation, together with outstanding accuracy.

Volumetric models typically employ a global code to represent facial expressions, such that they can be driven by a small set of animation parameters.

However, they can recreate training images faithfully despite image degradation in the form of blur, noise, and compression, generating similarly degraded images. To solve this problem, the recently proposed noise robust GAN (NR-GAN) provides a partial solution by demonstrating the ability to learn a clean image generator directly from noisy images using a two-generator model comprising image and noise generators. However, its application is limited to noise, which is relatively easy to decompose owing to its additive and reversible characteristics, and its application to irreversible image degradation, in the form of blur, compression, and combination of all, remains a challenge. To address these problems, we propose blur, noise, and compression robust GAN (BNCR-GAN) that can learn a clean image generator directly from degraded images without knowledge of degradation parameters (e.g., blur kernel types, noise amounts, or quality factor values). Inspired by NR-GAN, BNCR-GAN uses a multiple-generator model composed of image, blur-kernel, noise, and quality-factor generators. However, in contrast to NR-GAN, to address irreversible characteristics, we introduce masking architectures adjusting degradation strength values in a data-driven manner using bypasses before and after degradation. Furthermore, to suppress uncertainty caused by the combination of blur, noise, and compression, we introduce adaptive consistency losses imposing consistency between irreversible degradation processes according to the degradation strengths. We demonstrate the effectiveness of BNCR-GAN through large-scale comparative studies on CIFAR-10 and a generality analysis on FFHQ. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of BNCR-GAN in image restoration.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Kaneko_Blur_Noise_and_Compression_Robust_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

We demonstrate how an attacker can craft a modulated light signal that adversarially illuminates a scene and causes targeted misclassifications on a state-of-the-art ImageNet deep learning model. Concretely, we exploit the radiometric rolling shutter effect in commodity cameras to create precise striping patterns that appear on images.

The PM is designed to mimic the detection process in predation for positioning the potential target objects from a global perspective and the FM is then used to perform the identification process in predation for progressively refining the coarse prediction via focusing on the ambiguous regions. Notably, in the FM, we develop a novel distraction mining strategy for the distraction region discovery and removal, to benefit the performance of estimation.

Instead of representing scenes with regular grids, our method leverages the sparsity of point cloud data and focuses on predicting shapes that are recognized with high objectness. With this design, we decouple the instance reconstruction into global object localization and local shape prediction. It not only eases the difficulty of learning 2-D manifold surfaces from sparse 3D space, the point clouds in each object proposal convey shape details that support implicit function learning to reconstruct any high-resolution surfaces. Our experiments indicate that instance detection and reconstruction present complementary effects, where the shape prediction head shows consistent effects on improving object detection with modern 3D proposal network backbones.

We show that most current implementations of that concept have important theoretical and practical limitations, as they only partially align the feature distributions. We propose a novel approach that matches the distributions more precisely, thus reproducing the desired style more faithfully, while still being computationally efficient. Specifically, we adapt the dual form of Central Moment Discrepancy, as recently proposed for domain adaptation, to minimize the difference between the target style and the feature distribution of the output image. The dual interpretation of this metric explicitly matches all higher-order centralized moments and is therefore a natural extension of existing NST methods that only take into account the first and second moments.

To tackle this, we propose to Decouple the Operation and Topology Search (DOTS), which decouples the topology representation from operation weights and makes an explicit topology search. DOTS is achieved by introducing a topology search space that contains combinations of candidate edges. The proposed search space directly reflects the search objective and can be easily extended to support a flexible number of edges in the searched cell. Existing gradient-based NAS methods can be incorporated into DOTS for further improvement by the topology search. Considering that some operations (e.g., Skip-Connection) can affect the topology, we propose a group operation search scheme to preserve topology-related operations for a better topology search.

These early successes have laid the building blocks for the community to tackle tasks that require agents to actively interact with objects in their environment. Object manipulation is an established research domain within the robotics community and poses several challenges including manipulator motion, grasping and long-horizon planning, particularly when dealing with oft-overlooked practical setups involving visually rich and complex scenes, manipulation using mobile agents (as opposed to tabletop manipulation), and generalization to unseen environments and objects. We propose a framework for object manipulation built upon the physics-enabled, visually rich AI2-THOR framework and present a new challenge to the Embodied AI community known as ArmPointNav.

DeepI2P: Image-to-Point Cloud Registration via Deep Classification,"Jiaxin Li, Gim Hee Lee"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 15960-15969","This paper presents DeepI2P: a novel approach for cross-modality registration between an image and a point cloud. Given an image (e.g. from a rgb-camera) and a general point cloud (e.g. from a 3D Lidar scanner) captured at different locations in the same scene, our method estimates the relative rigid transformation between the coordinate frames of the camera and Lidar. Learning common feature descriptors to establish correspondences for the registration is inherently challenging due to the lack of appearance and geometric correlations across the two modalities. We circumvent the difficulty by converting the registration problem into a classification and inverse camera projection optimization problem. A classification neural network is designed to label whether the projection of each point in the point cloud is within or beyond the camera frustum. These labeled points are subsequently passed into a novel inverse camera projection solver to estimate the relative pose.

Intuitively, we comprehend the semantics of the instruction to form an overview of where a bathroom is and what a blue towel is in mind; then, we navigate to the target location by consistently matching the bathroom appearance in mind with the current scene.

To emulate the human ability in controlling caption generation, current CIC studies focus exclusively on control signals concerning objective properties, such as contents of interest or descriptive patterns. However, we argue that almost all existing objective control signals have overlooked two indispensable characteristics of an ideal control signal: 1) Event-compatible: all visual contents referred to in a single sentence should be compatible with the described activity. 2) Sample-suitable: the control signals should be suitable for a specific image sample. To this end, we propose a new control signal for CIC: Verb-specific Semantic Roles (VSR). VSR consists of a verb and some semantic roles, which represents a targeted activity and the roles of entities involved in this activity. Given a designated VSR, we first train a grounded semantic role labeling (GSRL) model to identify and ground all entities for each role. Then, we propose a semantic structure planner (SSP) to learn human-like descriptive semantic structures. Lastly, we use a role-shift captioning model to generate the captions. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate that our framework can achieve better controllability than several strong baselines on two challenging CIC benchmarks.

Though adversarial attacks have achieved incredible success rates in the white-box setting, most existing adversaries often exhibit weak transferability in the black-box setting, especially under the scenario of attacking models with defense mechanisms. In this work, we propose a new method called variance tuning to enhance the class of iterative gradient based attack methods and improve their attack transferability. Specifically, at each iteration for the gradient calculation, instead of directly using the current gradient for the momentum accumulation, we further consider the gradient variance of the previous iteration to tune the current gradient so as to stabilize the update direction and escape from poor local optima. Empirical results on the standard ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method could significantly improve the transferability of gradient-based adversarial attacks. Besides, our method could be used to attack ensemble models or be integrated with various input transformations. Incorporating variance tuning with input transformations on iterative gradient-based attacks in the multi-model setting, the integrated method could achieve an average success rate of 90.1% against nine advanced defense methods, improving the current best attack performance significantly by 85.1%.

We address this problem with the use of a novel Probabilistic Model Distillation (PMD) approach which transfers knowledge learned by a probabilistic teacher model on synthetic data to a static student model with the use of unlabeled real image pairs. A probabilistic supervision reweighting (PSR) module together with a confidence-aware loss (CAL) is used to mine the useful knowledge and alleviate the impact of errors. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show that our PMD achieves state-of-the-art performance. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach, we extend PMD to incorporate stronger supervision for better accuracy -- the probabilistic teacher is trained with stronger key-point supervision.

By adaptively dropping out different frames during training iterations of adversarial learning, we augment this input sample to train a temporally robust encoder. Second, we use temporal decay to model key attenuation in the memory queue when computing the contrastive loss. As the momentum encoder updates after keys enqueue, the representation ability of these keys degrades when we use the current input sample for contrastive learning.

While many approaches have been proposed to solve this problem, they only utilize source data during training, but do not take advantage of the fact that a single target example is available at the time of inference. Motivated by this, we propose a method that effectively uses the target sample during inference beyond mere classification. Our method has three components - (i) A label preserving feature or metric transformation on source data such that the source samples are clustered in accordance with their class irrespective of their domain (ii) A generative model trained on the these features (iii) A label-preserving projection of the target point on the source-feature manifold during inference via solving an optimization problem on the input space of the generative model using the learned metric. Finally, the projected target is used in the classifier. Since the projected target feature comes from the source manifold and has the same label as the real target by design, the classifier is expected to perform better on it than the true target.

It can be easily intractable where there exists ego-car pose change w.r.t. ground plane. This is common due to the slight fluctuation of road smoothness and slope. Due to the lack of insight in industrial application, existing methods on open datasets neglect camera pose information, which inevitably results in the detector being susceptible to camera extrinsic parameters. The perturbation of objects is very popular in most autonomous driving cases for industrial products. To this end, we propose a novel method to capture camera pose to formulate the detector free from extrinsic perturbation. Specifically, the proposed framework predicts camera extrinsic parameters by detecting vanishing point and horizon change. A converter is designed to rectify perturbative features in the latent space. By doing so, our 3D detector works independent of the extrinsic parameter variations, and produces accurate results in realistic cases, e.g., potholed and uneven roads, where almost all existing monocular detectors fail to handle.

Conventional approaches either learn completely from CAD-generated synthetic data, which have difficulty in inference from real images, or generate 2.5D depth image via intrinsic decomposition, which is limited compared to the full 3D reconstruction. One fundamental challenge lies in how to leverage numerous real 2D images without any 3D ground truth. To address this issue, we take an alternative approach with semi-supervised learning. That is, for a 2D image of a generic object, we decompose it into latent representations of category, shape and albedo, lighting and camera projection matrix, decode the representations to segmented 3D shape and albedo respectively, and fuse these components to render an image well approximating the input image. Using a category-adaptive 3D joint occupancy field (JOF), we show that the complete shape and albedo modeling enables us to leverage real 2D images in both modeling and model fitting. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through superior 3D reconstruction from a single image, being either synthetic or real, and shape segmentation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Liu_Fully_Understanding_Generic_Objects_Modeling_Segmentation_and_Reconstruction_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Our motivation is that regressing keypoint positions accurately needs to learn representations that focus on the keypoint regions. We present a simple yet effective approach, named disentangled keypoint regression (DEKR). We adopt adaptive convolutions through pixel-wise spatial transformer to activate the pixels in the keypoint regions and accordingly learn representations from them. We use a multi-branch structure for separate regression: each branch learns a representation with dedicated adaptive convolutions and regresses one keypoint. The resulting disentangled representations are able to attend to the keypoint regions, respectively, and thus the keypoint regression is spatially more accurate. We empirically show that the proposed direct regression method outperforms keypoint detection and grouping methods and achieves superior bottom-up pose estimation results on two benchmark datasets, COCO and CrowdPose.

From Synthetic to Real: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Animal Pose Estimation,"Chen Li, Gim Hee Lee"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 1482-1491","Animal pose estimation is an important field that has received increasing attention in the recent years. The main challenge for this task is the lack of labeled data. Existing works circumvent this problem with pseudo labels generated from data of other easily accessible domains such as synthetic data. However, these pseudo labels are noisy even with consistency check or confidence-based filtering due to the domain shift in the data. To solve this problem, we design a multi-scale domain adaptation module (MDAM) to reduce the domain gap between the synthetic and real data. We further introduce an online coarse-to-fine pseudo label updating strategy. Specifically, we propose a self-distillation module in an inner coarse-update loop and a mean-teacher in an outer fine-update loop to generate new pseudo labels that gradually replace the old ones. Consequently, our model is able to learn from the old pseudo labels at the early stage, and gradually switch to the new pseudo labels to prevent overfitting in the later stage.

Nevertheless, because of the intrinsic 2D-to-3D ambiguity, recovering camera-space 3D information from a single RGB image remains challenging. To tackle this problem, we divide camera-space mesh recovery into two sub-tasks, i.e., root-relative mesh recovery and root recovery. First, joint landmarks and silhouette are extracted from a single input image to provide 2D cues for the 3D tasks. In the root-relative mesh recovery task, we exploit semantic relations among joints to generate a 3D mesh from the extracted 2D cues. Such generated 3D mesh coordinates are expressed relative to a root position, i.e., wrist of the hand. In the root recovery task, the root position is registered to the camera space by aligning the generated 3D mesh back to 2D cues, thereby completing camera-space 3D mesh recovery. Our pipeline is novel in that (1) it explicitly makes use of known semantic relations among joints and (2) it exploits 1D projections of the silhouette and mesh to achieve robust registration.

The idea behind LBYL-Net is intuitive and straightforward: we follow a language's description to localize the target object based on its relative spatial relation to 'Landmarks', which is characterized by some spatial positional words and some descriptive words about the object. The core of our LBYL-Net is a landmark feature convolution module that transmits the visual features with the guidance of linguistic description along with different directions. Consequently, such a module encodes the relative spatial positional relations between the current object and its context. Then we combine the contextual information from the landmark feature convolution module with the target's visual features for grounding. To make this landmark feature convolution light-weight, we introduce a dynamic programming algorithm (termed dynamic max pooling) with low complexity to extract the landmark feature. Thanks to the landmark feature convolution module, we mimic the human behavior of `Look Before You Leap` to design an LBYL-Net, which takes full consideration of contextual information.

The key idea is to optimize for detection, alignment and shape jointly over all objects in the RGB image, while focusing on realistic and physically plausible reconstructions. To this end, we propose a key-point detector that localizes objects as center points and directly predicts all object properties, including 9-DoF bounding boxes and 3D shapes, all in a single forward pass. The method formulates 3D shape reconstruction as a shape selection problem, i.e. it selects among exemplar shapes from a given database. This makes it agnostic to shape representations, which enables a lightweight reconstruction of realistic and visually-pleasing shapes based on CAD-models, while the training objective is formulated around point clouds and voxel representations.

WSIs have very high resolutions and usually lack localized annotations. WSI classification can be cast as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem when only slide-level labels are available. We propose a MIL-based method for WSI classification and tumor detection that does not require localized annotations. Our method has three major components. First, we introduce a novel MIL aggregator that models the relations of the instances in a dual-stream architecture with trainable distance measurement. Second, since WSIs can produce large or unbalanced bags that hinder the training of MIL models, we propose to use self-supervised contrastive learning to extract good representations for MIL and alleviate the issue of prohibitive memory cost for large bags. Third, we adopt a pyramidal fusion mechanism for multiscale WSI features, and further improve the accuracy of classification and localization. Our model is evaluated on two representative WSI datasets. The classification accuracy of our model compares favorably to fully-supervised methods, with less than 2% accuracy gap across datasets. Our results also outperform all previous MIL-based methods.

Though many DA theories and algorithms have been proposed, most of them are tailored into classification settings and may fail in regression tasks, especially in the practical keypoint detection task. To tackle this difficult but significant task, we present a method of regressive domain adaptation (RegDA) for unsupervised keypoint detection. Inspired by the latest theoretical work, we first utilize an adversarial regressor to maximize the disparity on the target domain and train a feature generator to minimize this disparity. However, due to the high dimension of the output space, this regressor fails to detect samples that deviate from the support of the source. To overcome this problem, we propose two important ideas. First, based on our observation that the probability density of the output space is sparse, we introduce a spatial probability distribution to describe this sparsity and then use it to guide the learning of the adversarial regressor. Second, to alleviate the optimization difficulty in the high-dimensional space, we innovatively convert the minimax game in the adversarial training to the minimization of two opposite goals.

We present a new neural representation for face reflectance where we can estimate all components of the reflectance responsible for the final appearance from a monocular image.

Our key technical contribution is to show that, by training the network to explicitly discriminate challenging image fragments, even for images that do contain the object emitting the sound, we can significantly boost the localization performance. We do so elegantly by introducing a mechanism to mine hard samples and add them to a contrastive learning formulation automatically. We show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on the popular Flickr SoundNet dataset. Furthermore, we introduce the VGG-Sound Source (VGG-SS) benchmark, a new set of annotations for the recently-introduced VGG-Sound dataset, where the sound sources visible in each video clip are explicitly marked with bounding box annotations. This dataset is 20 times larger than analogous existing ones, contains 5K videos spanning over 200 categories, and, differently from Flickr SoundNet, is video-based. On VGG-SS, we also show that our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance against several baselines.

The overall methodology, called Synthesize-It-Classifier (STIC), does not require an explicit generator network to estimate the density of the data distribution and sample images from that, but instead uses the classifier's knowledge of the boundary to perform gradient ascent w.r.t. class logits and then synthesizes images using Gram Matrix Metropolis Adjusted Langevin Algorithm (GRMALA) by drawing on a blank canvas. During training, the classifier iteratively uses these synthesized images as fake samples and re-estimates the class boundary in a recurrent fashion to improve both the classification accuracy and quality of synthetic images. The STIC shows that mixing of the hard fake samples (i.e. those synthesized by the one hot class conditioning), and the soft fake samples (which are synthesized as a convex combination of classes, i.e. a mixup of classes) improves class interpolation. We demonstrate an Attentive-STIC network that shows iterative drawing of synthesized images on the ImageNet dataset that has thousands of classes.

In the self-supervised manner, establishing correspondences between two point clouds to approximate scene flow is an effective approach. Previous methods often obtain correspondences by applying point-wise matching that only takes the distance on 3D point coordinates into account, introducing two critical issues: (1) it overlooks other discriminative measures, such as color and surface normal, which often bring fruitful clues for accurate matching; and (2) it often generates sub-par performance, as the matching is operated in an unconstrained situation, where multiple points can be ended up with the same corresponding point. To address the issues, we formulate this matching task as an optimal transport problem. The output optimal assignment matrix can be utilized to guide the generation of pseudo ground truth. In this optimal transport, we design the transport cost by considering multiple descriptors and encourage one-to-one matching by mass equality constraints. Also, constructing a graph on the points, a random walk module is introduced to encourage the local consistency of the pseudo labels.

Stable View Synthesis,"Gernot Riegler, Vladlen Koltun"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 12216-12225","We present Stable View Synthesis (SVS). Given a set of source images depicting a scene from freely distributed viewpoints, SVS synthesizes new views of the scene. The method operates on a geometric scaffold computed via structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo. Each point on this 3D scaffold is associated with view rays and corresponding feature vectors that encode the appearance of this point in the input images. The core of SVS is view-dependent on-surface feature aggregation, in which directional feature vectors at each 3D point are processed to produce a new feature vector for a ray that maps this point into the new target view. The target view is then rendered by a convolutional network from a tensor of features synthesized in this way for all pixels. The method is composed of differentiable modules and is trained end-to-end. It supports spatially-varying view-dependent importance weighting and feature transformation of source images at each point; spatial and temporal stability due to the smooth dependence of on-surface feature aggregation on the target view; and synthesis of view-dependent effects such as specular reflection. Experimental results demonstrate that SVS outperforms state-of-the-art view synthesis methods both quantitatively and qualitatively on three diverse real-world datasets, achieving unprecedented levels of realism in free-viewpoint video of challenging large-scale scenes.

Furthermore, optimizing the model over brief clips impedes its ability to learn long-term temporal dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a collaborative memory mechanism that encodes information across multiple sampled clips of a video at each training iteration. This enables the learning of long-range dependencies beyond a single clip. We explore different design choices for the collaborative memory to ease the optimization difficulties.

Prior work alleviates this issue by either monitoring the face quality in pre-processing or predicting the data uncertainty along with the face feature. This paper proposes MagFace, a category of losses that learn a universal feature embedding whose magnitude before normalization can measure with the quality of the given face. Under the new loss, it can be proven that the magnitude of the feature embedding monotonically increases if the subject is more likely to be recognized. In addition, MagFace introduces an adaptive mechanism to learn a well-structured within-class feature distributions by pushing easy samples to class centers while pushing hard samples away. This prevents models from overfitting on noisy low-quality samples and improves face recognition in the wild.

Wasserstein Barycenter for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation,"Eduardo Fernandes Montesuma, Fred Maurice Ngole Mboula"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 16785-16793","Multi-source domain adaptation is a key technique that allows a model to be trained on data coming from various probability distribution. To overcome the challenges posed by this learning scenario, we propose a method for constructing an intermediate domain between sources and target domain, the Wasserstein Barycenter Transport (WBT). This method relies on the barycenter on Wasserstein spaces for aggregating the source probability distributions. Once the sources have been aggregated, they are transported to the target domain using standard Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation framework. Additionally, we revisit previous single-source domain adaptation tasks in the context of multi-source scenario. In particular, we apply our algorithm to object and face recognition datasets.

Following the paradigm in supervised manner, most existing unsupervised metric learning approaches mainly focus on binary similarity in Euclidean space. However, these methods cannot achieve promising performance in many practical applications, where the manual information is lacking and data exhibits non-Euclidean latent anatomy. To address this limitation, we propose an Unsupervised Hyperbolic Metric Learning method with Hierarchical Similarity. It considers the natural hierarchies of data by taking advantage of Hyperbolic metric learning and hierarchical clustering, which can effectively excavate richer similarity information beyond binary in modeling. More importantly, we design a new loss function to capture the hierarchical similarity among samples to enhance the stability of the proposed method.

With a text-to-gloss translation model, we first back-translate the monolingual text to its gloss sequence. Then, the paired sign sequence is generated by splicing pieces from an estimated gloss-to-sign bank at the feature level.

In this common, real-world scenario, almost all images belong to the background category in the dataset. We find that state-of-the-art approaches for training on imbalanced datasets do not produce accurate deep models in this regime. Our solution is to split the large, visually diverse background into many smaller, visually similar categories during training. We implement this idea by extending an image classification model with an additional auxiliary loss that learns to mimic the predictions of a pre-existing classification model on the training set. The auxiliary loss requires no additional human labels and regularizes feature learning in the shared network trunk by forcing the model to discriminate between auxiliary categories for all training set examples, including those belonging to the monolithic background of the main rare category classification task. To evaluate our method we contribute modified versions of the iNaturalist and Places365 datasets where only a small subset of rare category labels are available during training (all other images are labeled as background). By jointly learning to recognize both the selected rare categories and auxiliary categories, our approach yields models that perform 8.3 mAP points higher than state-of-the-art imbalanced learning baselines when 98.30% of the data is background, and up to 42.3 mAP points higher than fine-tuning baselines when 99.98% of the data is background.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Mullapudi_Background_Splitting_Finding_Rare_Classes_in_a_Sea_of_Background_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

The state of the art in neural style transfer is based on Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN), a technique that transfers the statistical properties of style features to a content image, and can transfer a large number of styles in real time. However, AdaIN is a global operation; thus local geometric structures in the style image are often ignored during the transfer.

Few-Shot Incremental Learning With Continually Evolved Classifiers,"Chi Zhang, Nan Song, Guosheng Lin, Yun Zheng, Pan Pan, Yinghui Xu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 12455-12464","Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to design machine learning algorithms that can continually learn new concepts from a few data points, without forgetting knowledge of old classes. The difficulty lies in that limited data from new classes not only lead to significant overfitting issues but also exacerbate the notorious catastrophic forgetting problems. Moreover, as training data come in sequence in FSCIL, the learned classifier can only provide discriminative information in individual sessions, while FSCIL requires all classes to be involved for evaluation. In this paper, we address the FSCIL problem from two aspects. First, we adopt a simple but effective decoupled learning strategy of representations and classifiers that only the classifiers are updated in each incremental session, which avoids knowledge forgetting in the representations. By doing so, we demonstrate that a pre-trained backbone plus a non-parametric class mean classifier can beat state-of-the-art methods. Second, to make the classifiers learned on individual sessions applicable to all classes, we propose a Continually Evolved Classifier (CEC) that employs a graph model to propagate context information between classifiers for adaptation. To enable the learning of CEC, we design a pseudo incremental learning paradigm that episodically constructs a pseudo incremental learning task to optimize the graph parameters by sampling data from the base dataset. Experiments on three popular benchmark datasets, including CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and Caltech-USCD Birds-200-2011 (CUB200), show that our method significantly outperforms the baselines and sets new state-of-the-art results with remarkable advantages.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Zhang_Few-Shot_Incremental_Learning_With_Continually_Evolved_Classifiers_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

However, the definitions of events are diverse which could be as simple as a single action or as complex as a set of events, depending on different semantic contexts. Therefore, directly detecting events based on video information is ill-defined and hurts the coherency and accuracy of generated dense captions. In this work, we reverse the predominant ""detect-then-describe"" fashion, proposing a top-down way to first generate paragraphs from a global view and then ground each event description to a video segment for detailed refinement. It is formulated as a Sketch, Ground, and Refine process (SGR). The sketch stage first generates a coarse-grained multi-sentence paragraph to describe the whole video, where each sentence is treated as an event and gets localised in the grounding stage. In the refining stage, we improve captioning quality via refinement-enhanced training and dual-path cross attention on both coarse-grained event captions and aligned event segments.

Current anchor-based monocular 3D object detection methods suffer from feature mismatching. To overcome this, we propose a two-step feature alignment approach. In the first step, the shape alignment is performed to enable the receptive field of the feature map to focus on the pre-defined anchors with high confidence scores. In the second step, the center alignment is used to align the features at 2D/3D centers. Further, it is often difficult to learn global information and capture long-range relationships, which are important for the depth prediction of objects. Therefore, we propose a novel asymmetric non-local attention block with multi-scale sampling to extract depth-wise features.

Structure-Aware Face Clustering on a Large-Scale Graph With 107 Nodes,"Shuai Shen, Wanhua Li, Zheng Zhu, Guan Huang, Dalong Du, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 9085-9094","Face clustering is a promising method for annotating unlabeled face images. Recent supervised approaches have boosted the face clustering accuracy greatly, however their performance is still far from satisfactory. These methods can be roughly divided into global-based and local-based ones. Global-based methods suffer from the limitation of training data scale, while local-based ones are difficult to grasp the whole graph structure information and usually take a long time for inference. Previous approaches fail to tackle these two challenges simultaneously. To address the dilemma of large-scale training and efficient inference, we propose the STructure-AwaRe Face Clustering (STAR-FC) method. Specifically, we design a structure-preserved subgraph sampling strategy to explore the power of large-scale training data, which can increase the training data scale from 10^5 to 10^7. During inference, the STAR-FC performs efficient full-graph clustering with two steps: graph parsing and graph refinement. And the concept of node intimacy is introduced in the second step to mine the local structural information. The STAR-FC gets 91.97 pairwise F-score on partial MS1M within 310s which surpasses the state-of-the-arts. Furthermore, we are the first to train on very large-scale graph with 20M nodes, and achieve superior inference results on 12M testing data. Overall, as a simple and effective method, the proposed STAR-FC provides a strong baseline for large-scale face clustering.

Permuted AdaIN: Reducing the Bias Towards Global Statistics in Image Classification,"Oren Nuriel, Sagie Benaim, Lior Wolf"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 9482-9491","Recent work has shown that convolutional neural network classifiers overly rely on texture at the expense of shape cues. We make a similar but different distinction between shape and local image cues, on the one hand, and global image statistics, on the other. Our method, called Permuted Adaptive Instance Normalization (pAdaIN), reduces the representation of global statistics in the hidden layers of image classifiers. pAdaIN samples a random permutation p that rearranges the samples in a given batch. Adaptive Instance Normalization (AdaIN) is then applied between the activations of each (non-permuted) sample i and the corresponding activations of the sample p(i), thus swapping statistics between the samples of the batch. Since the global image statistics are distorted, this swapping procedure causes the network to rely on cues, such as shape or texture. By choosing the random permutation with probability p and the identity permutation otherwise, one can control the effect's strength. With the correct choice of p, fixed apriori for all experiments and selected without considering test data, our method consistently outperforms baselines in multiple settings. In image classification, our method improves on both CIFAR100 and ImageNet using multiple architectures. In the setting of robustness, our method improves on both ImageNet-C and Cifar-100-C for multiple architectures.

Built upon the recent advances in generative adversarial networks (GANs), recent L2I models have made great progress. However, a close inspection of their generated images reveals two major limitations: (1) the object-to-object as well as object-to-stuff relations are often broken and (2) each object's appearance is typically distorted lacking the key defining characteristics associated with the object class. We argue that these are caused by the lack of context-aware object and stuff feature encoding in their generators, and location-sensitive appearance representation in their discriminators. To address these limitations, two new modules are proposed in this work. First, a contextual feature transformation module is introduced in the generator to ensure that the generated feature encoding of either object or stuff is aware of other co-existing objects/stuff in the scene. Second, instead of feeding location-insensitive image features to the discriminator, we use the Gram matrix computed from the feature maps of the generated object images to preserve location-sensitive information, resulting in much enhanced object appearance.

By incorporating a mask embedding module, the discriminator features are associated with spatial information, such that the focus of the discriminator can be limited in the specified regions when distinguishing between real and synthesized images. A generator is enforced to synthesize the instances holding more precise class semantics in order to deceive the enhanced discriminator. Also benefiting from mask embedding, region-based semantic regularization is imposed on the discriminator feature space, and the degree of separation between real and fake classes and among object categories can thus be increased.

To address this issue, this paper proposes a normalizing flow-based kernel prior (FKP) for kernel modeling. By learning an invertible mapping between the anisotropic Gaussian kernel distribution and a tractable latent distribution, FKP can be easily used to replace the kernel modeling modules of Double-DIP and KernelGAN. Specifically, FKP optimizes the kernel in the latent space rather than the network parameter space, which allows it to generate reasonable kernel initialization, traverse the learned kernel manifold and improve the optimization stability.

Previous methods often regard the moving objects as primary ones and rely on optical flow to capture the motion cues in videos, but the flow information alone is insufficient to distinguish the primary objects from the background objects that move together. This is because, when the noisy motion features are combined with the appearance features, the localization of the primary objects is misguided. To address this problem, we propose a novel reciprocal transformation network to discover primary objects by correlating three key factors: the intra-frame contrast, the motion cues, and temporal coherence of recurring objects. Each corresponds to a representative type of primary object, and our reciprocal mechanism enables an organic coordination of them to effectively remove ambiguous distractions from videos.

We present the first approach to learn complete 3D models of face identity and expression geometry, and reflectance, just from images and videos. The virtually endless collection of such data, in combination with our self-supervised learning-based approach allows for learning face models that generalize beyond the span of existing approaches. Our network design and loss functions ensure a disentangled parameterization of not only identity and albedo, but also, for the first time, an expression basis.

Bottom-Up Shift and Reasoning for Referring Image Segmentation,"Sibei Yang, Meng Xia, Guanbin Li, Hong-Yu Zhou, Yizhou Yu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 11266-11275","Referring image segmentation aims to segment the referent that is the corresponding object or stuff referred by a natural language expression in an image. Its main challenge lies in how to effectively and efficiently differentiate between the referent and other objects of the same category as the referent. In this paper, we tackle the challenge by jointly performing compositional visual reasoning and accurate segmentation in a single stage via the proposed novel Bottom-Up Shift (BUS) and Bidirectional Attentive Refinement (BIAR) modules. Specifically, BUS progressively locates the referent along hierarchical reasoning steps implied by the expression. At each step, it locates the corresponding visual region by disambiguating between similar regions, where the disambiguation bases on the relationships between regions. By the explainable visual reasoning, BUS explicitly aligns linguistic components with visual regions so that it can identify all the mentioned entities in the expression. BIAR fuses multi-level features via a two-way attentive message passing, which captures the visual details relevant to the referent to refine segmentation results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consisting of BUS and BIAR modules, can not only consistently surpass all existing state-of-the-art algorithms across common benchmark datasets but also visualize interpretable reasoning steps for stepwise segmentation.

A new deformation can then be generated by sampling the coefficients of the meta-handles in a specific range. We employ biharmonic coordinates as the deformation function, which can smoothly propagate the control points' translations to the entire mesh. To avoid learning zero deformation as meta-handles, we incorporate a target-fitting module which deforms the input mesh to match a random target.

The weakly supervised temporal localization problem investigates whether this task can be adequately solved with only video-level labels, significantly reducing the amount of expensive and error-prone annotation that is required. A common approach is to train a frame-level classifier where frames with the highest class probability are selected to make a video-level prediction. Frame-level activations are then used for localization. However, the absence of frame-level annotations cause the classifier to impart class bias on every frame. To address this, we propose the Action Selection Learning (ASL) approach to capture the general concept of action, a property we refer to as ""actionness"".

To address this issue, we propose a dynamic on-demand network (DoDNet) that learns to segment multiple organs and tumors on partially labeled datasets. DoDNet consists of a shared encoder-decoder architecture, a task encoding module, a controller for dynamic filter generation, and a single but dynamic segmentation head. The information of current segmentation task is encoded as a task-aware prior to tell the model what the task is expected to achieve.

Instead of domain-level distribution matching, as popularly adopted in the literature, we propose to learn pixel-wise cross-domain correspondences for more precise knowledge transfer. It is realized through a novel cross-domain co-attention scheme trained as region competition. In this scheme, the cross-domain correspondence module seeks for informative features on the target domain image, which after being warped to the source domain image, could best explain its annotations. Meanwhile, a collaborative mask generator competes to mask out the relevant target image region to make the remaining features uninformative. Such competitive learning strives to correlate the full foreground in cross-domain image pairs, revealing the accurate object extent in target domain. To alleviate the ambiguity of inter-domain correspondence learning, a domain-cycle consistency regularizer is futher proposed to leverage the more reliable intra-domain correspondence.

To fully explore the potential of dilated convolution, we proposed a new type of dilated convolution (referred to as inception convolution), where the convolution operations have independent dilation patterns among different axes, channels and layers. To develop a practical method for learning complex inception convolution based on the data, a simple but effective search algorithm, referred to as efficient dilation optimization (EDO), is developed. Based on statistical optimization, the EDO method operates in a low-cost manner and is extremely fast when it is applied on large scale datasets. Empirical results validate that our method achieves consistent performance gains for image recognition, object detection, instance segmentation, human detection, and human pose estimation.

However, there is still a large gap on performance compared to their supervised counterparts. We focus on a more practical setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) where both a small set of labeled target data and large amounts of labeled source data are available. To address the task of SSDA, a novel framework based on dual-level domain mixing is proposed. The proposed framework consists of three stages. First, two kinds of data mixing methods are proposed to reduce domain gap in both region-level and sample-level respectively. We can obtain two complementary domain-mixed teachers based on dual-level mixed data from holistic and partial views respectively. Then, a student model is learned by distilling knowledge from these two teachers.

Our insight is that these methods would lead to poor adaptation with redundant matching, and leveraging channel-wise adjustment is the key to well adapting the learned knowledge to new classes. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to learn a dynamic alignment, which can effectively highlight both query regions and channels according to different local support information. Specifically, this is achieved by first dynamically sampling the neighbourhood of the feature position conditioned on the input few shot, based on which we further predict a both position-dependent and channel-dependent Dynamic Meta-filter. The filter is used to align the query feature with position-specific and channel-specific knowledge. Moreover, we adopt Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) to enable a more accurate control of the alignment. In such a sense our model is able to better capture fine-grained semantic context of the few-shot example and thus facilitates dynamical knowledge adaptation for few-shot learning.

Exploring Heterogeneous Clues for Weakly-Supervised Audio-Visual Video Parsing,"Yu Wu, Yi Yang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 1326-1335","We investigate the weakly-supervised audio-visual video parsing task, which aims to parse a video into temporal event segments and predict the audible or visible event categories. The task is challenging since there only exist video-level event labels for training, without indicating the temporal boundaries and modalities. Previous works take the overall event labels to supervise both audio and visual model predictions. However, we argue that such overall labels harm the model training due to the audio-visual asynchrony. For example, commentators speak in a basketball video, but we cannot visually find the speakers. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the cross-modal correspondence of audio and visual signals. We generate reliable event labels individually for each modality by swapping audio and visual tracks with other unrelated videos. If the original visual/audio data contain event clues, the event prediction from the newly assembled data would still be highly confident. In this way, we could protect our models from being misled by ambiguous event labels. In addition, we propose the cross-modal audio-visual contrastive learning to induce temporal difference on attention models within videos, i.e., urging the model to pick the current temporal segment from all context candidates.

Dogfight: Detecting Drones From Drones Videos,"Muhammad Waseem Ashraf, Waqas Sultani, Mubarak Shah"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 7067-7076","As airborne vehicles are becoming more autonomous and ubiquitous, it has become vital to develop the capability to detect the objects in their surroundings. This paper attempts to address the problem of drones detection from other flying drones. The erratic movement of the source and target drones, small size, arbitrary shape, large intensity variations, and occlusion make this problem quite challenging. In this scenario, region-proposal based methods are not able to capture sufficient discriminative foreground-background information. Also, due to the extremely small size and complex motion of the source and target drones, feature aggregation based methods are unable to perform well. To handle this, instead of using region-proposal based methods, we propose to use a two-stage segmentation-based approach employing spatio-temporal attention cues. During the first stage, given the overlapping frame regions, detailed contextual information is captured over convolution feature maps using pyramid pooling. After that pixel and channel-wise attention is enforced on the feature maps to ensure accurate drone localization. In the second stage, first stage detections are verified and new probable drone locations are explored. To discover new drone locations, motion boundaries are used. This is followed by tracking candidate drone detections for a few frames, cuboid formation, extraction of the 3D convolution feature map, and drones detection within each cuboid. The proposed approach is evaluated on two publicly available drone detection datasets and outperforms over several competitive baselines.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Ashraf_Dogfight_Detecting_Drones_From_Drones_Videos_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

To cope with this issue, we propose a source-free domain adaptation framework for semantic segmentation, namely SFDA, in which only a well-trained source model and an unlabeled target domain dataset are available for adaptation. SFDA not only enables to recover and preserve the source domain knowledge from the source model via knowledge transfer during model adaptation, but also distills valuable information from the target domain for self-supervised learning.

We argue that this kind of state driven visual reasoning approach has limitations in reflecting whether the machine has the ability to infer the dynamics between different states, which has been shown as important as state-level reasoning for human cognition in Piaget's theory. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel transformation driven visual reasoning task.

Following this definition, a new dataset namely TRANCE is constructed on the basis of CLEVR, including three levels of settings, i.e. Basic (single-step transformation), Event (multi-step transformation), and View (multi-step transformation with variant views). Experimental results show that the state-of-the-art visual reasoning models perform well on Basic, but are still far from human-level intelligence on Event and View.

Our method relies on the power of recent GANs to generate realistic images. We show how the GAN latent code can be decoded to produce a semantic segmentation of the image. Training the decoder only needs a few labeled examples to generalize to the rest of the latent space, resulting in an infinite annotated dataset generator! These generated datasets can then be used for training any computer vision architecture just as real datasets are. As only a few images need to be manually segmented, it becomes possible to annotate images in extreme detail and generate datasets with rich object and part segmentations. To showcase the power of our approach, we generated datasets for 7 image segmentation tasks which include pixel-level labels for 34 human face parts, and 32 car parts. Our approach outperforms all semi-supervised baselines significantly and is on par with fully supervised methods using labor-intensive annotations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Zhang_DatasetGAN_Efficient_Labeled_Data_Factory_With_Minimal_Human_Effort_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Our key idea is to leverage a trained GAN to extract a pixel-wise representation from the input image and use it as feature vectors for a segmentation network. Our experiments demonstrate that this GAN-derived representation is ""readily discriminative"" and produces surprisingly good results that are comparable to those from supervised baselines trained with significantly more labels.

To tackle these challenges, we propose a unified framework for estimating the 3D hand and object poses with semi-supervised learning. We build a joint learning framework where we perform explicit contextual reasoning between hand and object representations. Going beyond limited 3D annotations in a single image, we leverage the spatial-temporal consistency in large-scale hand-object videos as a constraint for generating pseudo labels in semi-supervised learning. Our method not only improves hand pose estimation in challenging real-world dataset, but also substantially improve the object pose which has fewer ground-truths per instance.

However, a fundamental challenge in SBIR has been largely ignored so far, that is, sketches are drawn by humans and considerable style variations exist amongst different users. An effective SBIR model needs to explicitly account for this style diversity, crucially, to generalise to unseen user styles. To this end, a novel style-agnostic SBIR model is proposed. Different from existing models, a cross-modal variational autoencoder (VAE) is employed to explicitly disentangle each sketch into a semantic content part shared with the corresponding photo, and a style part unique to the sketcher. Importantly, to make our model dynamically adaptable to any unseen user styles, we propose to meta-train our cross-modal VAE by adding two style-adaptive components: a set of feature transformation layers to its encoder and a regulariser to the disentangled semantic content latent code. With this meta-learning framework, our model can not only disentangle the cross-modal shared semantic content for SBIR, but can adapt the disentanglement to any unseen user style as well, making the SBIR model truly style-agnostic.

While numerous efforts have been made in this field, recent approaches still suffer from two challenges: one is the part domination issue while the other is the learning robustness issue. Specifically, the former makes the localizer prone to the local discriminative object regions rather than the desired whole object, and the latter makes the localizer over-sensitive to the variations of the input images so that one can hardly obtain localization results robust to the arbitrary visual stimulus. To solve these issues, we propose a novel framework to strengthen the learning tolerance, referred to as SLT-Net, for WSOL. Specifically, we consider two-fold learning tolerance strengthening mechanisms. One is the semantic tolerance strengthening mechanism, which allows the localizer to make mistakes for classifying similar semantics so that it will not concentrate too much on the discriminative local regions. The other is the visual stimuli tolerance strengthening mechanism, which enforces the localizer to be robust to different image transformations so that the prediction quality will not be sensitive to each specific input image.

The main challenge of UniDA lies in how to separate common classes (i.e., classes shared across domains), from private classes (i.e., classes only exist in one domain). Previous works treat the private samples in the target as one generic class but ignore their intrinsic structure. Consequently, the resulting representations are not compact enough in the latent space and can be easily confused with common samples. To better exploit the intrinsic structure of the target domain, we propose Domain Consensus Clustering(DCC), which exploits the domain consensus knowledge to discover discriminative clusters on both common samples and private ones. Specifically, we draw the domain consensus knowledge from two aspects to facilitate the clustering and the private class discovery, i.e., the semantic-level consensus, which identifies the cycle-consistent clusters as the common classes, and the sample-level consensus, which utilizes the cross-domain classification agreement to determine the number of clusters and discover the private classes. Based on DCC, we are able to separate the private classes from the common ones, and differentiate the private classes themselves. Finally, we apply a class-aware alignment technique on identified common samples to minimize the distribution shift, and a prototypical regularizer to inspire discriminative target clusters.

In this work we propose EnD, a regularization strategy whose aim is to prevent deep models from learning unwanted biases. In particular, we insert an """"information bottleneck"""" at a certain point of the deep neural network, where we disentangle the information about the bias, still letting the useful information for the training task forward-propagating in the rest of the model. One big advantage of EnD is that it does not require additional training complexity (like decoders or extra layers in the model), since it is a regularizer directly applied on the trained model.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first generation-based method to attack deep hashing networks. Generally, our proposed framework consists of three parts, i.e., a PrototypeNet, a generator and a discriminator. Specifically, the designed PrototypeNet embeds the target label into the semantic representation and learns the prototype code as the category-level representative of the target label. Moreover, the semantic representation and the original image are jointly fed into the generator for flexible targeted attack. Particularly, the prototype code is adopted to supervise the generator to construct the targeted adversarial example by minimizing the Hamming distance between the hash code of the adversarial example and the prototype code. Furthermore, the generator is against the discriminator to simultaneously encourage the adversarial examples visually realistic and the semantic representation informative.

During image generation, we modulate deepfeatures of input random noise from coarse-to-fine by injecting an initially restored image and the hole regions inmultiple scales. We argue that during hole filling, the pixels near the hole boundary should be more deterministic(i.e., with higher probability trusting the context and initially restored image to create natural inpainting boundary), while those pixels lie in the center of the hole shouldenjoy more degrees of freedom (i.e., more likely to dependon the random noise for enhancing diversity).

Finally, a refinement stage restores the missing high frequency in the denoised frame. All stages operate on a transform-domain representation obtained by learnable and invertible linear operators which simultaneously increase accuracy and decrease complexity of the model. A single loss on the final output is sufficient for successful convergence, hence making EMVD easy to train.

Recent VSE models use complex methods to better contextualize and aggregate multi-modal features into holistic embeddings. However, we discover that surprisingly simple (but carefully selected) global pooling functions (e.g., max pooling) outperform those complex models, across different feature extractors. Despite its simplicity and effectiveness, seeking the best pooling function for different data modality and feature extractor is costly and tedious, especially when the size of features varies (e.g., text, video). Therefore, we propose a Generalized Pooling Operator (GPO), which learns to automatically adapt itself to the best pooling strategy for different features, requiring no manual tuning while staying effective and efficient.

Meanwhile, current unsupervised detectors are unable to generate aligned keypoints with good coverage. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised aligned keypoint detector, Skeleton Merger, which utilizes skeletons to reconstruct objects. It is based on an Autoencoder architecture. The encoder proposes keypoints and predicts activation strengths of edges between keypoints. The decoder performs uniform sampling on the skeleton and refines it into small point clouds with pointwise offsets. Then the activation strengths are applied and the sub-clouds are merged. Composite Chamfer Distance (CCD) is proposed as a distance between the input point cloud and the reconstruction composed of sub-clouds masked by activation strengths.

To that end, we introduce a novel Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) model that encodes proximal relationships, called POSA for ""Pose with prOximitieS and contActs"". The representation of interaction is body-centric, which enables it to generalize to new scenes. Specifically, POSA augments the SMPL-X parametric human body model such that, for every mesh vertex, it encodes (a) the contact probability with the scene surface and (b) the corresponding semantic scene label. We learn POSA with a VAE conditioned on the SMPL-X vertices, and train on the PROX dataset, which contains SMPL-X meshes of people interacting with 3D scenes, and the corresponding scene semantics from the PROX-E dataset. We demonstrate the value of POSA with two applications. First, we automatically place 3D scans of people in scenes. We use a SMPL-X model fit to the scan as a proxy and then find its most likely placement in 3D. POSA provides an effective representation to search for ""affordances"" in the scene that match the likely contact relationships for that pose.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework called shift-invariant pan-sharpening with moving object alignment (SIPSA-Net) which is the first method to take into account such large misalignment of moving object regions for PAN sharpening. The SISPA-Net has a feature alignment module (FAM) that can adjust one feature to be aligned to another feature, even between the two different PAN and MS domains. For better alignment in pan-sharpened images, a shift-invariant spectral loss is newly designed, which ignores the inherent misalignment in the original MS input, thereby having the same effect as optimizing the spectral loss with a well-aligned MS image. Extensive experimental results show that our SIPSA-Net can generate pan-sharpened images with remarkable improvements in terms of visual quality and alignment, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Lee_SIPSA-Net_Shift-Invariant_Pan_Sharpening_With_Moving_Object_Alignment_for_Satellite_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Our study reveals two key findings. First, physical backdoor attacks can be highly successful if they are carefully configured to overcome the constraints imposed by physical objects. In particular, the placement of successful triggers is largely constrained by the victim model's dependence on key facial features. Second, four of today's state-of-the-art defenses against (digital) backdoors are ineffective against physical backdoors, because the use of physical objects breaks core assumptions used to construct these defenses.

However, satisfying performance highly depends on a large number of pixel-level annotations. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on the semi-supervised segmentation problem where only a small set of labeled data is provided with a much larger collection of totally unlabeled images. Nevertheless, due to the limited annotations, models may overly rely on the contexts available in the training data, which causes poor generalization to the scenes unseen before. A preferred high-level representation should capture the contextual information while not losing self-awareness. Therefore, we propose to maintain the context-aware consistency between features of the same identity but with different contexts, making the representations robust to the varying environments. Moreover, we present the Directional Contrastive Loss (DC Loss) to accomplish the consistency in a pixel-to-pixel manner, only requiring the feature with lower quality to be aligned towards its counterpart.

Despite achieving high performance, it is still largely unknown how well existing detectors generalize to unseen data. This is important because a practical detector should be ready to use in various scenarios in applications. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive study in this paper, using a general principle of direct cross-dataset evaluation. Through this study, we find that existing state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors, though perform quite well when trained and tested on the same dataset, generalize poorly in cross dataset evaluation. We demonstrate that there are two reasons for this trend. Firstly, their designs (e.g. anchor settings) may be biased towards popular benchmarks in the traditional single-dataset training and test pipeline, but as a result largely limit their generalization capability. Secondly, the training source is generally not dense in pedestrians and diverse in scenarios. Under direct cross-dataset evaluation, surprisingly, we find that a general purpose object detector, without pedestrian-tailored adaptation in design, generalizes much better compared to existing state-of-the-art pedestrian detectors. Furthermore, we illustrate that diverse and dense datasets, collected by crawling the web, serve to be an efficient source of pre-training for pedestrian detection. Accordingly, we propose a progressive training pipeline and find that it works well for autonomous-driving oriented pedestrian detection. Consequently, the study conducted in this paper suggests that more emphasis should be put on cross-dataset evaluation for the future design of generalizable pedestrian detectors.

Complex lane line shapes require high-dimensional output of CNNs to model global structures, which further increases the demand for model capacity and training data. In contrast, the locality of a lane marker has finite geometric variations and spatial coverage. We propose a novel lane marker detection solution, FOLOLane, that focuses on modeling local patterns and achieving prediction of global structures in a bottom-up manner. Specifically, the CNN models low-complexity local patterns with two separate heads, the first one predicts the existence of key points, and the second refines the location of key points in the local range and correlates key points of the same lane line. The locality of the task is consistent with the limited FOV of the feature in CNN, which in turn leads to more stable training and better generalization. In addition, an efficiency-oriented decoding algorithm was proposed as well as a greedy one, which achieving 36% runtime gains at the cost of negligible performance degradation. Both of the two decoders integrated local information into the global geometry of lane markers.

To address this problem, we propose a class-aware memory network that explicitly reasons about local style variations. A key-values memory structure, with a set of read/update operations, is introduced to record class-wise style variations and access them without requiring an object detector at the test time. The key stores a domain-agnostic content representation for allocating memory items, while the values encode domain-specific style representations.

PixMatch: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation via Pixelwise Consistency Training,"Luke Melas-Kyriazi, Arjun K. Manrai"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 12435-12445","Unsupervised domain adaptation is a promising technique for semantic segmentation and other computer vision tasks for which large-scale data annotation is costly and time-consuming. In semantic segmentation particularly, it is attractive to train models on annotated images from a simulated (source) domain and deploy them on real (target) domains. In this work, we present a novel framework for unsupervised domain adaptation based on the notion of target-domain consistency training. Intuitively, our work is based on the insight that in order to perform well on the target domain, a model's output should be consistent with respect to small perturbations of inputs in the target domain. Specifically, we introduce a new loss term to enforce pixelwise consistency between the model's predictions on a target image and perturbed version of the same image. In comparison to popular adversarial adaptation methods, our approach is simpler, easier to implement, and more memory-efficient during training. Experiments and ablation studies demonstrate that our simple approach achieves remarkably strong results on two challenging synthetic-to-real benchmarks, GTA5-to-Cityscapes and SYNTHIA-to-Cityscapes.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Melas-Kyriazi_PixMatch_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptation_via_Pixelwise_Consistency_Training_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Therefore, existing CNN-based methods involve redundant computation in flat regions, which increases their computational cost and limits their applications on mobile devices. In this paper, we explore the sparsity in image SR to improve inference efficiency of SR networks. Specifically, we develop a Sparse Mask SR (SMSR) network to learn sparse masks to prune redundant computation. Within our SMSR, spatial masks learn to identify ""important"" regions while channel masks learn to mark redundant channels in those ""unimportant"" regions. Consequently, redundant computation can be accurately localized and skipped while maintaining comparable performance.

Understanding the Behaviour of Contrastive Loss,"Feng Wang, Huaping Liu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 2495-2504","Unsupervised contrastive learning has achieved outstanding success, while the mechanism of contrastive loss has been less studied. In this paper, we concentrate on the understanding of the behaviours of unsupervised contrastive loss. We will show that the contrastive loss is a hardness-aware loss function, and the temperature t controls the strength of penalties on hard negative samples. The previous study has shown that uniformity is a key property of contrastive learning. We build relations between the uniformity and the temperature t. We will show that uniformity helps the contrastive learning to learn separable features, however excessive pursuit to the uniformity makes the contrastive loss not tolerant to semantically similar samples, which may break the underlying semantic structure and be harmful to the formation of features useful for downstream tasks. This is caused by the inherent defect of the instance discrimination objective. Specifically, instance discrimination objective tries to push all different instances apart, ignoring the underlying relations between samples. Pushing semantically consistent samples apart has no positive effect for acquiring a prior informative to general downstream tasks. A well-designed contrastive loss should have some extents of tolerance to the closeness of semantically similar samples. Therefore, we find that the contrastive loss meets a uniformity-tolerance dilemma, and a good choice of temperature can compromise these two properties properly to both learn separable features and tolerant to semantically similar samples, improving the feature qualities and the downstream performances.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Wang_Understanding_the_Behaviour_of_Contrastive_Loss_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

To this end, we propose Variational Prototype Learning (VPL), which represents every class as a distribution instead of a point in the latent space. By identifying the slow feature drift phenomenon, we directly inject memorized features into prototypes to approximate variational prototype sampling. The proposed VPL can simulate sample-to-sample comparisons within the classification framework, encouraging the SGD solver to be more exploratory, while boosting performance.

However, due to the domain shift problem, applying the knowledge of an object detector learned from one specific domain to another one often suffers severe performance degradation. Most existing methods adopt feature alignment either on the backbone network or instance classifier to increase the transferability of object detector. Different from existing methods, we propose to perform feature alignment of foreground and background in the RPN stage such that the foreground and background RPN proposals in target domain can be effectively separated. Specifically, we first construct one set of learnable RPN prototypes, and then enforce the RPN features to align with the prototypes for both source and target domains. It essentially cooperates the learning of RPN prototypes and features to align the source and target RPN features. In this paradigm, the pseudo label of proposals in target domain need be first generated, and we propose a simple yet effective method suitable for RPN feature alignment,i.e., using the filtered detection results to guide the pseudo label generation of RPN proposals by IoU. Furthermore, we adopt Grad CAM to find the discriminative region within a proposal and use it to increase the discriminability of RPN features for alignment by spatially weighting.

However, regressing TTC for each pixel is not straightforward, and most existing methods make over-simplifying assumptions about the scene. We address this challenge by estimating TTC via a series of simpler, binary classifications.

However, lack of proper evaluation measures makes it difficult to compare approaches, hampering progress in the field. Traditional measures, such as PSNR or SSIM, are known to poorly correlate with the human perception of image quality. Therefore, in existing works common practice is also to report Mean-Opinion-Score (MOS) -- the results of human evaluation of super-resolved images. Unfortunately, the MOS values from different papers are not directly comparable, due to the varying number of raters, their subjectivity, etc. By this paper, we introduce Neural Side-By-Side -- a new measure that allows super-resolution models to be compared automatically, effectively approximating human preferences. Namely, we collect a large dataset of aligned image pairs, which were produced by different super-resolution models. Then each pair is annotated by several raters, who were instructed to choose a more visually appealing image. Given the dataset and the labels, we trained a CNN model that obtains a pair of images and for each image predicts a probability of being more preferable than its counterpart. In this work, we show that Neural Side-By-Side generalizes across both new models and new data.

Coordinate Attention for Efficient Mobile Network Design,"Qibin Hou, Daquan Zhou, Jiashi Feng"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 13713-13722","Recent studies on mobile network design have demonstrated the remarkable effectiveness of channel attention (e.g., the Squeeze-and-Excitation attention) for lifting model performance, but they generally neglect the positional information, which is important for generating spatially selective attention maps. In this paper, we propose a novel attention mechanism for mobile networks by embedding positional information into channel attention, which we call ""coordinate attention"". Unlike channel attention that transforms a feature tensor to a single feature vector via 2D global pooling, the coordinate attention factorizes channel attention into two 1D feature encoding processes that aggregate features along the two spatial directions, respectively. In this way, long-range dependencies can be captured along one spatial direction and meanwhile precise positional information can be preserved along the other spatial direction. The resulting feature maps are then encoded separately into a pair of direction-aware and position-sensitive attention maps that can be complementarily applied to the input feature map to augment the representations of the objects of interest. Our coordinate attention is simple and can be flexibly plugged into classic mobile networks, such as MobileNetV2, MobileNeXt, and EfficientNet with nearly no computational overhead.

Different from previous image-to-image translation methods that formulate the translation as pixel-wise prediction, we deal with such an artistic creation process in a vectorized environment and produce a sequence of physically meaningful stroke parameters that can be further used for rendering. Since a typical vector render is not differentiable, we design a novel neural renderer which imitates the behavior of the vector renderer and then frame the stroke prediction as a parameter searching process that maximizes the similarity between the input and the rendering output. We explored the zero-gradient problem on parameter searching and propose to solve this problem from an optimal transportation perspective. We also show that previous neural renderers have a parameter coupling problem and we re-design the rendering network with a rasterization network and a shading network that better handles the disentanglement of shape and color. Experiments show that the paintings generated by our method have a high degree of fidelity in both global appearance and local textures. Our method can be also jointly optimized with neural style transfer that further transfers visual style from other images.

Image Change Captioning by Learning From an Auxiliary Task,"Mehrdad Hosseinzadeh, Yang Wang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 2725-2734","We tackle the challenging task of image change captioning. The goal is to describe the subtle difference between two very similar images by generating a sentence caption. While the recent methods mainly focus on proposing new model architectures for this problem, we instead focus on an alternative training scheme. Inspired by the success of multi-task learning, we formulate a training scheme that uses an auxiliary task to improve the training of the change captioning network. We argue that the task of composed query image retrieval is a natural choice as the auxiliary task. Given two almost similar images as the input, the primary network generates a caption describing the fine change between those two images. Next, the auxiliary network is provided with the generated caption and one of those two images. It then tries to pick the second image among a set of candidates. This forces the primary network to generate detailed and precise captions via having an extra supervision loss by the auxiliary network. Furthermore, we propose a new scheme for selecting a negative set of candidates for the retrieval task that can effectively improve the performance.

In this paper, we study the problem of multi-source domain generalization in ReID, which aims to learn a model that can perform well on unseen domains with only several labeled source domains. To address this problem, we propose the Memory-based Multi-Source Meta-Learning (M^3L) framework to train a generalizable model for unseen domains. Specifically, a meta-learning strategy is introduced to simulate the train-test process of domain generalization for learning more generalizable models. To overcome the unstable meta-optimization caused by the parametric classifier, we propose a memory-based identification loss that is non-parametric and harmonizes with meta-learning. We also present a meta batch normalization layer (MetaBN) to diversify meta-test features, further establishing the advantage of meta-learning.

Even powerful deep neural networks could hardly recover traceless shadow-removed background. This paper proposes a new solution for this task by formulating it as an exposure fusion problem to address the challenges. Intuitively, we first estimate multiple over-exposure images w.r.t. the input image to let the shadow regions in these images have the same color with shadow-free areas in the input image. Then, we fuse the original input with the over-exposure images to generate the final shadow-free counterpart. Nevertheless, the spatial-variant property of the shadow requires the fusion to be sufficiently `smart', that is, it should automatically select proper over-exposure pixels from different images to make the final output natural. To address this challenge, we propose the shadow-aware FusionNet that takes the shadow image as input to generate fusion weight maps across all the over-exposure images. Moreover, we propose the boundary-aware RefineNet to eliminate the remaining shadow trace further.

In this paper, we investigate the hypothesis that this sampling bottleneck can potentially be mitigated by identifying ways to directly propagate the covariance matrix of the smoothed distribution through the network. To this end, we find that other than certain adjustments to the network, propagating the covariances must also be accompanied by additional accounting that keeps track of how the distributional moments transform and interact at each stage in the network.

One main issue, widely known to the community, is that object boundaries derived only from 2D image appearance are ambiguous and unreliable. To address this, we exploit LiDAR clues to aid unsupervised object detection. By exploiting the 3D scene structure, the issue of localization can be considerably mitigated. We further identify another major issue, seldom noticed by the community, that the long-tailed and open-ended (sub-)category distribution should be accommodated. In this paper, we present the first practical method for unsupervised object detection with the aid of LiDAR clues.

We propose TesseTrack, a novel top-down approachthat simultaneously reasons about multiple individuals' 3Dbody joint reconstructions and associations in space andtime in a single end-to-end learnable framework. At the core of our approach is a novel spatio-temporal formulation that operates in a common voxelized feature space aggregated from single- or multiple-camera views. After a person detection step, a 4D CNN produces short-term person-specific representations which are then linked across time by a differentiable matcher. The linked descriptions are then merged and deconvolved into 3D poses. This joint spatio-temporal formulation contrasts with previous piece-wise strategies that treat 2D pose estimation, 2D-to-3D lifting, and 3D pose tracking as independent sub-problems that are error-prone when solved in isolation. Furthermore, unlike previous methods, TesseTrack is robust to changes in the number of camera views and achieves very good results even if a single view is available at inference time. Quantitative evaluation of 3D pose reconstruction accuracy on standard benchmarks shows significant improvements over the state of the art.

Voxel-based features are efficient to extract, while they fail to preserve fine-grained 3D structures of objects. Point-based features, on the other hand, represent the 3D structures more accurately, but extracting these features is computationally expensive. We introduce in this paper a novel single-stage 3D detection method having the merit of both voxel-based and point-based features. To this end, we propose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, dubbed HVPR, that integrates both features into a single 3D representation effectively and efficiently. Specifically, we augment the point-based features with a memory module to reduce the computational cost. We then aggregate the features in the memory, semantically similar to each voxel-based one, to obtain a hybrid 3D representation in a form of a pseudo image, allowing to localize 3D objects in a single stage efficiently. We also propose an Attentive Multi-scale Feature Module (AMFM) that extracts scale-aware features considering the sparse and irregular patterns of point clouds.

Our method analyzes the difference between the shapes of the two objects by comparing their latent representations. This latent representation is in the form of 3D keypoints that are learned in an unsupervised way. The difference between the 3D keypoints of the source and the target objects then informs the shape deformation algorithm that deforms the source object into the target object.

Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) is the classic architecture to build a feature pyramid with high-level semantics throughout. However, intrinsic defects in feature extraction and fusion inhibit FPN from further aggregating more discriminative features. In this work, we propose Attention Aggregation based Feature Pyramid Network (A^2-FPN), to improve multi-scale feature learning through attention-guided feature aggregation. In feature extraction, it extracts discriminative features by collecting-distributing multi-level global context features, and mitigates the semantic information loss due to drastically reduced channels. In feature fusion, it aggregates complementary information from adjacent features to generate location-wise reassembly kernels for content-aware sampling, and employs channel-wise reweighting to enhance the semantic consistency before element-wise addition. A^2-FPN shows consistent gains on different instance segmentation frameworks.

Common camouflage include background matching, imitating the color and pattern of the environment, and disruptive coloration, disguising body outlines. Camouflaged object detection (COD) aims to segment camouflaged objects hiding in their surroundings. Existing COD models are built upon binary ground truth to segment the camouflaged objects without illustrating the level of camouflage. In this paper, we revisit this task and argue that explicitly modeling the conspicuousness of camouflaged objects against their particular backgrounds can not only lead to a better understanding about camouflage and evolution of animals, but also provide guidance to design more sophisticated camouflage techniques. Furthermore, we observe that it is some specific parts of the camouflaged objects that make them detectable by predators. With the above understanding about camouflaged objects, we present the first ranking based COD network to simultaneously localize, segment and rank camouflaged objects. The localization model is proposed to find the discriminative regions that make the camouflaged object obvious. The segmentation model segments the full scope of the camouflaged objects. And, the ranking model infers the detectability of different camouflaged objects. Moreover, we contribute a large COD testing set to evaluate the generalization ability of COD models.

Most of the existing efforts speed up some steps at the cost of a significant slowdown of other steps or sacrificing the support of non-differentiable search metrics. The unbalanced reduction in the time spent per step limits the total search time reduction, and the inability to support non-differentiable search metrics limits the performance of discovered DNNs. In this paper, we present NetAdaptV2 with three innovations to better balance the time spent for each step while supporting non-differentiable search metrics. First, we propose channel-level bypass connections that merge network depth and layer width into a single search dimension to reduce the time for training and evaluating sampled DNNs.

This task, however, is very challenging because an image often contains complex texts and visual information that is hard to be described comprehensively. Existing methods attempt to extend the traditional image captioning methods to solve this task, which focus on describing the overall scene of images by one global caption. This is infeasible because the complex text and visual information cannot be described well within one caption. To resolve this difficulty, we seek to generate multiple captions that accurately describe different parts of an image in detail. To achieve this purpose, there are three key challenges: 1) it is hard to decide which parts of the texts of images to copy or paraphrase; 2) it is non-trivial to capture the complex relationship between diverse texts in an image; 3) how to generate multiple captions with diverse content is still an open problem. To conquer these, we propose a novel Anchor-Captioner method. Specifically, we first find the important tokens which are supposed to be paid more attention to and consider them as anchors. Then, for each chosen anchor, we group its relevant texts to construct the corresponding anchor-centred graph (ACG).

Whilst the number of photos can be easily scaled, each corresponding sketch still needs to be individually produced. In this paper, we aim to mitigate such an upper-bound on sketch data, and study whether unlabelled photos alone (of which they are many) can be cultivated for performance gain. In particular, we introduce a novel semi-supervised framework for cross-modal retrieval that can additionally leverage large-scale unlabelled photos to account for data scarcity. At the center of our semi-supervision design is a sequential photo-to-sketch generation model that aims to generate paired sketches for unlabelled photos. Importantly, we further introduce a discriminator-guided mechanism to guide against unfaithful generation, together with a distillation loss-based regularizer to provide tolerance against noisy training samples. Last but not least, we treat generation and retrieval as two conjugate problems, where a joint learning procedure is devised for each module to mutually benefit from each other.

Especially, prior to practical applications, it is crucial to analyze a model's inference and the process of generating the results. A common explanation method is Class Activation Mapping(CAM) based method where it is often used to understand the last layer of the convolutional neural networks popular in the field of Computer Vision. In this paper, we propose a novel CAM method named Relevance-weighted Class Activation Mapping(Relevance-CAM) that utilizes Layer-wise Relevance Propagation to obtain the weighting components. This allows the explanation map to be faithful and robust to the shattered gradient problem, a shared problem of the gradient based CAM methods that causes noisy saliency maps for intermediate layers.

Existing FSS methods find the query object by using support prototypes or by directly relying on heuristic multi-scale feature fusion. However, they fail to fully leverage the high-order appearance relationships between multi-scale features among the support-query image pairs, thus leading to an inaccurate localization of the query objects. To tackle the above challenge, we propose an end-to-end scale-aware graph neural network (SAGNN) by reasoning the cross-scale relations among the support-query images for FSS. Specifically, a scale-aware graph is first built by taking support-induced multi-scale query features as nodes and, meanwhile, each edge is modeled as the pairwise interaction of its connected nodes. By progressive message passing over this graph, SAGNN is capable of capturing cross-scale relations and overcoming object variations (e.g., appearance, scale and location), and can thus learn more precise node embeddings. This in turn enables it to predict more accurate foreground objects. Moreover, to make full use of the location relations across scales for the query image, a novel self-node collaboration mechanism is proposed to enrich the current node, which endows SAGNN the ability of perceiving different resolutions of the same objects.

Adaptive Class Suppression Loss for Long-Tail Object Detection,"Tong Wang, Yousong Zhu, Chaoyang Zhao, Wei Zeng, Jinqiao Wang, Ming Tang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 3103-3112","To address the problem of long-tail distribution for the large vocabulary object detection task, existing methods usually divide the whole categories into several groups and treat each group with different strategies. These methods bring the following two problems. One is the training inconsistency between adjacent categories of similar sizes, and the other is that the learned model is lack of discrimination for tail categories which are semantically similar to some of the head categories. In this paper, we devise a novel Adaptive Class Suppression Loss (ACSL) to effectively tackle the above problems and improve the detection performance of tail categories. Specifically, we introduce a statistic-free perspective to analyze the long-tail distribution, breaking the limitation of manual grouping. According to this perspective, our ACSL adjusts the suppression gradients for each sample of each class adaptively, ensuring the training consistency and boosting the discrimination for rare categories. Extensive experiments on long-tail datasets LVIS and Open Images show that the our ACSL achieves 5.18% and 5.2% improvements with ResNet50-FPN, and sets a new state of the art.

In recent literature, it is shown that pre-trained GANs, on a different dataset, can be transferred to improve the image generation from a small target data. The same, however, has not been well-studied in the case of conditional GANs (cGANs), which provides new opportunities for knowledge transfer compared to unconditional setup. In particular, the new classes may borrow knowledge from the related old classes, or share knowledge among themselves to improve the training. This motivates us to study the problem of efficient conditional GAN transfer with knowledge propagation across classes. To address this problem, we introduce a new GAN transfer method to explicitly propagate the knowledge from the old classes to the new classes. The key idea is to enforce the popularly used conditional batch normalization (BN) to learn the class-specific information of the new classes from that of the old classes, with implicit knowledge sharing among the new ones. This allows for an efficient knowledge propagation from the old classes to the new ones, with the BN parameters increasing linearly with the number of new classes. The extensive evaluation demonstrates the clear superiority of the proposed method over state-of-the-art competitors for efficient conditional GAN transfer tasks.

Unlike these approaches, FCSGG is a conceptually elegant and efficient bottom-up approach that encodes objects as bounding box center points, and relationships as 2D vector fields which are named as Relation Affinity Fields (RAFs). RAFs encode both semantic and spatial features, and explicitly represent the relationship between a pair of objects by the integral on a sub-region that points from subject to object.

Network Quantization With Element-Wise Gradient Scaling,"Junghyup Lee, Dohyung Kim, Bumsub Ham"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 6448-6457","Network quantization aims at reducing bit-widths of weights and/or activations, particularly important for implementing deep neural networks with limited hardware resources. Most methods use the straight-through estimator (STE) to train quantized networks, which avoids a zero-gradient problem by replacing a derivative of a discretizer (i.e., a round function) with that of an identity function. Although quantized networks exploiting the STE have shown decent performance, the STE is sub-optimal in that it simply propagates the same gradient without considering discretization errors between inputs and outputs of the discretizer. In this paper, we propose an element-wise gradient scaling (EWGS), a simple yet effective alternative to the STE, training a quantized network better than the STE in terms of stability and accuracy. Given a gradient of the discretizer output, EWGS adaptively scales up or down each gradient element, and uses the scaled gradient as the one for the discretizer input to train quantized networks via backpropagation. The scaling is performed depending on both the sign of each gradient element and an error between the continuous input and discrete output of the discretizer. We adjust a scaling factor adaptively using Hessian information of a network.

The undesirable phenomenon of multi-path occurs when a camera pixel simultaneously sees features from multiple projector coordinates. Bimodal multi-path is a particularly common situation found along step edges, where the camera pixel sees both a foreground and background surface. Generalized from bimodal multi-path, this paper looks at sparse or N modal multi-path as a more general case, where the camera pixel sees no less than two reflective surfaces, resulting in decoding errors.

To relieve these two issues, instead, we propose to progressively evolve the initial text proposal to arbitrarily shaped text contours in a top-down manner. The initial horizontal text proposals are generated by estimating the center and size of texts. To reduce the range of regression, the first stage of the evolution predicts the corner points of oriented text proposals from the initial horizontal ones. In the second stage, the contours of the oriented text proposals are iteratively regressed to arbitrarily shaped ones. In the last iteration of this stage, we rescore the confidence of the final localized text by utilizing the cues from multiple contour points, rather than the single cue from the initial horizontal proposal center that may be out of arbitrary-shape text regions. Moreover, to facilitate the progressive contour evolution, we design a contour information aggregation mechanism to enrich the feature representation on text contours by considering both the circular topology and semantic context.

To cope with this problem, recent work performed instance-wise cross-domain self-supervised learning, followed by an additional fine-tuning stage. However, the instance-wise self-supervised learning only learns and aligns low-level discriminative features. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Prototypical Cross-domain Self-Supervised Learning (PCS) framework for Few-shot Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (FUDA).

HybrIK: A Hybrid Analytical-Neural Inverse Kinematics Solution for 3D Human Pose and Shape Estimation,"Jiefeng Li, Chao Xu, Zhicun Chen, Siyuan Bian, Lixin Yang, Cewu Lu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 3383-3393","Model-based 3D pose and shape estimation methods reconstruct a full 3D mesh for the human body by estimating several parameters. However, learning the abstract parameters is a highly non-linear process and suffers from image-model misalignment, leading to mediocre model performance. In contrast, 3D keypoint estimation methods combine deep CNN network with the volumetric representation to achieve pixel-level localization accuracy but may predict unrealistic body structure. In this paper, we address the above issues by bridging the gap between body mesh estimation and 3D keypoint estimation. We propose a novel hybrid inverse kinematics solution (HybrIK). HybrIK directly transforms accurate 3D joints to relative body-part rotations for 3D body mesh reconstruction, via the twist-and-swing decomposition. The swing rotation is analytically solved with 3D joints, and the twist rotation is derived from the visual cues through the neural network. We show that HybrIK preserves both the accuracy of 3D pose and the realistic body structure of the parametric human model, leading to a pixel-aligned 3D body mesh and a more accurate 3D pose than the pure 3D keypoint estimation methods. Without bells and whistles, the proposed method surpasses the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on various 3D human pose and shape benchmarks. As an illustrative example, HybrIK outperforms all the previous methods by 13.2 mm MPJPE and 21.9 mm PVE on 3DPW dataset.

Here, we explore a dynamic network slimming regime, named Dynamic Slimmable Network (DS-Net), which aims to achieve good hardware-efficiency via dynamically adjusting filter numbers of networks at test time with respect to different inputs, while keeping filters stored statically and contiguously in hardware to prevent the extra burden. Our DS-Net is empowered with the ability of dynamic inference by the proposed double-headed dynamic gate that comprises an attention head and a slimming head to predictively adjust network width with negligible extra computation cost.

The proposals generated by current methods still suffer from inaccurate temporal boundaries and inferior confidence used for retrieval owing to the lack of efficient temporal modeling and effective boundary context utilization. In this paper, we propose Temporal Context Aggregation Network (TCANet) to generate high-quality action proposals through local and global temporal context aggregation and complementary as well as progressive boundary refinement. Specifically, we first design a Local-Global Temporal Encoder (LGTE), which adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both local and global temporal inter-dependencies. Furthermore, both the boundary and internal context of proposals are adopted for frame-level and segment-level boundary regressions, respectively. Temporal Boundary Regressor (TBR) is designed to combine these two regression granularities in an end-to-end fashion, which achieves the precise boundaries and reliable confidence of proposals through progressive refinement. Extensive experiments are conducted on three challenging datasets: HACS, ActivityNet-v1.3, and THUMOS-14, where TCANet can generate proposals with high precision and recall. By combining with the existing action classifier, TCANet can obtain remarkable temporal action detection performance compared with other methods.

The training loss will increase and penalize the algorithm when the output does not exactly match the GT target, even when the outputs are mathematically valid candidates according to the SR framework. This becomes more problematic for the blind SR, as diverse unknown blur kernels exacerbate the ill-posedness of the problem.

A novel differentiable search framework is proposed to support fast gradient-based search within a highly flexible network topology search space. The discretization of the searched optimal continuous model in differentiable scheme may produce a sub-optimal final discrete model (discretization gap). Therefore, we propose a topology loss to alleviate this problem. In addition, the GPU memory usage for the searched 3D model is limited with budget constraints during search.

But, while a vast body of work has focused on generative algorithms for raster images, only a handful of options exists for vector graphics. One can always rasterize the input graphic and resort to image-based generative approaches, but this negates the advantages of the vector representation. The current alternative is to use specialized models that require explicit supervision on the vector graphics representation at training time. This is not ideal because large-scale high-quality vector-graphics datasets are difficult to obtain. Furthermore, the vector representation for a given design is not unique, so models that supervise on the vector representation are unnecessarily constrained. Instead, we propose a new neural network that can generate complex vector graphics with varying topologies, and only requires in-direct supervision from readily-available raster training images (i.e., with no vector counterparts). To enable this, we use a differentiable rasterization pipeline that renders the generated vector shapes and composites them together onto a raster canvas. We demonstrate our method on a range of datasets, and provide comparison with state-of-the-art SVG-VAE and DeepSVG, both of which require explicit vector graphics supervision.

To date, VQA models are primarily assessed by their accuracy on high-level reasoning questions. Nevertheless, Given that perception tasks (e.g., recognizing objects) are the building blocks in the compositional process required by high-level reasoning, there is a demanding need to gain insights into how much of a problem low-level perception is. Inspired by the principles of software metamorphic testing, we introduce MetaVQA, a model-agnostic framework for benchmarking perception capability of VQA models. Given an image i, MetaVQA is able to synthesize a low level perception question q. It then jointly transforms (i, q) to one or a set of sub-questions and sub-images. MetaVQA checks whether the answer to (i, q) satisfies metamorphic relationships (MRs), denoting perception consistency, with the composed answers of transformed questions and images. Violating MRs denotes a failure of answering perception questions. MetaVQA successfully detects over 4.9 million perception failures made by popular VQA models with metamorphic testing. The state-of-the-art VQA models (e.g., the champion of VQA 2020 Challenge) suffer from perception consistency problems. In contrast, the Oscar VQA models, by using anchor points to align questions and images, show generally better consistency in perception tasks.

To remove such a dependency and further improve the part segmentation performance, we develop a novel approach by disentangling the appearance and shape representations of object parts followed with reconstruction losses without using additional object mask information. To avoid degenerated solutions, a bottleneck block is designed to squeeze and expand the appearance representation, leading to a more effective disentanglement between geometry and appearance. Combined with a self-supervised part classification loss and an improved geometry concentration constraint, we can segment more consistent parts with semantic meanings.

Existing attack methods aim to deceive convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classifiers by manipulating RGB images that are fed directly to the classifiers. However, these approaches typically neglect the influence of the camera optics and image processing pipeline (ISP) that produce the network inputs. ISPs transform RAW measurements to RGB images and traditionally are assumed to preserve adversarial patterns. In fact, these low-level pipelines can destroy, introduce or amplify adversarial patterns that can deceive a downstream detector. As a result, optimized patterns can become adversarial for the classifier after being transformed by a certain camera ISP or optical lens system but not for others. In this work, we examine and develop such an attack that deceives a specific camera ISP while leaving others intact, using the same downstream classifier. We frame this camera-specific attack as a multi-task optimization problem, relying on a differentiable approximation for the ISP itself. We validate the proposed method using recent state-of-the-art automotive hardware ISPs, achieving 92% fooling rate when attacking a specific ISP.

The ground-truth heatmaps are usually constructed by covering all skeletal keypoints by 2D gaussian kernels. The standard deviations of these kernels are fixed. However, for bottom-up methods, which need to handle a large variance of human scales and labeling ambiguities, the current practice seems unreasonable. To better cope with these problems, we propose the scale-adaptive heatmap regression (SAHR) method, which can adaptively adjust the standard deviation for each keypoint. In this way, SAHR is more tolerant of various human scales and labeling ambiguities.

We achieve these results by replacing a standard deep network with a suitable linear approximation. With opportune changes to the network architecture and training procedure, we show that such linear approximation achieves comparable performance to the original network and that the forgetting problem becomes quadratic and can be solved efficiently even for large models.

Existing methods, that rely on recurrent or self-attention models to enforce temporal consistency, work on the feature level, ignoring the task-specific temporal dependencies, and fail to model context uncertainty. To alleviate these issues, we build upon the framework of Neural Processes to propose a method for apparent emotion recognition with three key novel components: (a) probabilistic contextual representation with a global latent variable model; (b) temporal context modelling using task-specific predictions in addition to features; and (c) smart temporal context selection.

ID-Unet: Iterative Soft and Hard Deformation for View Synthesis,"Mingyu Yin, Li Sun, Qingli Li"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 7220-7229","View synthesis is usually done by an autoencoder, in which the encoder maps a source view image into a latent content code, and the decoder transforms it into a target view image according to the condition. However, the source contents are often not well kept in this setting, which leads to unnecessary changes during the view translation. Although adding skipped connections, like Unet, alleviates the problem, but it often causes the failure on the view conformity. This paper proposes a new architecture by performing the source-to-target deformation in an iterative way. Instead of simply incorporating the features from multiple layers of the encoder, we design soft and hard deformation modules, which warp the encoder features to the target view at different resolutions, and give results to the decoder to complement the details. Particularly, the current warping flow is not only used to align the feature of the same resolution, but also as an approximation to coarsely deform the high resolution feature. Then the residual flow is estimated and applied in the high resolution, so that the deformation is built up in the coarse-to-fine fashion. To better constrain the model, we synthesize a rough target view image based on the intermediate flows and their warped features. The extensive ablation studies and the final results on two different data sets show the effectiveness of the proposed model.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Yin_ID-Unet_Iterative_Soft_and_Hard_Deformation_for_View_Synthesis_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Such positional encoding is indispensable for generating images with high fidelity. The same phenomenon is observed in other generative architectures such as DCGAN and PGGAN. We further show that zero padding leads to an unbalanced spatial bias with a vague relation between locations.

FPs are pervasive artifacts which occur around depth edges, where light paths from both an object and its background are integrated over the aperture. This light mixes at a sensor pixel to produce erroneous depth estimates, which can adversely affect downstream 3D vision tasks. Mask-ToF starts at the source of these FPs, learning a microlens-level occlusion mask which effectively creates a custom-shaped sub-aperture for each sensor pixel. This modulates the selection of foreground and background light mixtures on a per-pixel basis and thereby encodes scene geometric information directly into the ToF measurements. We develop a differentiable ToF simulator to jointly train a convolutional neural network to decode this information and produce high-fidelity, low-FP depth reconstructions. We test the effectiveness of Mask-ToF on a simulated light field dataset and validate the method with an experimental prototype.

The quantization of weights and feature maps (activations) is a popular approach to solve this problem. Training-aware quantization often shows excellent results but requires a full dataset, which is not always available. Post-training quantization methods, in turn, are applied without fine-tuning but still work well for many classes of tasks like classification, segmentation, and so on. However, they either imply a big overhead for quantization parameters (QPs) calculation at runtime (dynamic methods) or lead to an accuracy drop if pre-computed static QPs are used (static methods). Moreover, most inference frameworks don't support dynamic quantization. Thus we propose a novel quantization approach called QPP: quantization parameter prediction. With a small subset of a training dataset or unlabeled data from the same domain, we find the predictor that can accurately estimate QPs of activations given only the NN's input data. Such a predictor allows us to avoid complex calculation of precise values of QPs while maintaining the quality of the model. To illustrate our method's efficiency, we added QPP into two dynamic approaches: 1) Dense+Sparse quantization, where the predetermined percentage of activations are not quantized, 2) standard quantization with equal quantization steps.

Tan"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 11977-11986","Most existing nighttime visibility enhancement methods focus on low light. Night images, however, do not only suffer from low light, but also from man-made light effects such as glow, glare, floodlight, etc. Hence, when the existing nighttime visibility enhancement methods are applied to these images, they intensify the effects, degrading the visibility even further. High dynamic range (HDR) imaging methods can address the low light and over-exposed regions, however they cannot remove the light effects, and thus cannot enhance the visibility in the affected regions. In this paper, given a single nighttime image as input, our goal is to enhance its visibility by increasing the dynamic range of the intensity, and thus can boost the intensity of the low light regions, and at the same time, suppress the light effects (glow, glare) simultaneously. First, we use a network to estimate the camera response function (CRF) from the input image to linearise the image. Second, we decompose the linearised image into low-frequency (LF) and high-frequency (HF) feature maps that are processed separately through two networks for light effects suppression and noise removal respectively. Third, we use a network to increase the dynamic range of the processed LF feature maps, which are then combined with the processed HF feature maps to generate the final output that has increased dynamic range and suppressed light effects.

A theoretical analysis established in this study suggests that those locally smooth model explanations are learned using a batch of noisy copies of the input with the L1 regularization for a saliency map. Extensive experiments support the analysis results, revealing that the proposed saliency maps retrieve the original classes of adversarial examples crafted against both naturally and adversarially trained models, significantly outperforming previous methods.

Existing methods for learning with noisy labels are limited by two aspects. Firstly, methods based on the noise probability modeling can only be applied to class-level noisy labels. Secondly, others based on the memorization effect outperform in synthetic noise but get weak promotion in real-world noisy datasets. To solve these problems, this paper proposes a novel label-noise robust method named Discrepant Adversarial Training (DAT). The DAT method has ability of enforcing prominent feature extraction by matching feature distribution between clean and noisy data. Therefore, under the noise-free feature representation, the deep network can simply output the correct result. To better capture the divergence between the noisy and clean distribution, a new metric is designed to change the distribution divergence into computable. By minimizing the proposed metric with a min-max training of discrepancy on classifiers and generators, DAT can match noisy data to clean data in the feature space. To the best of our knowledge, DAT is the first to address the noisy label problem from the perspective of the feature distribution.

However, several studies showed that it is vulnerable to adversarial attacks. In particular, an attacker can make a classifier predict an incorrect label for a 3D point cloud via carefully modifying, adding, and/or deleting a small number of its points. Randomized smoothing is state-of-the-art technique to build certifiably robust 2D image classifiers. However, when applied to 3D point cloud classification, randomized smoothing can only certify robustness against adversarially modified points. In this work, we propose PointGuard, the first defense that has provable robustness guarantees against adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points. Specifically, given a 3D point cloud and an arbitrary point cloud classifier, our PointGuard first creates multiple subsampled point clouds, each of which contains a random subset of the points in the original point cloud; then our PointGuard predicts the label of the original point cloud as the majority vote among the labels of the subsampled point clouds predicted by the point cloud classifier. Our first major theoretical contribution is that we show PointGuard provably predicts the same label for a 3D point cloud when the number of adversarially modified, added, and/or deleted points is bounded. Our second major theoretical contribution is that we prove the tightness of our derived bound when no assumptions on the point cloud classifier are made.

To make full use of the valuable labeled data, we introduce the multi-source concept into UDA person re-ID field, where multiple source datasets are used during training.

First, a rectification domain-specific batch normalization (RDSBN) module is explored to simultaneously reduce domain-specific characteristics and increase the distinctiveness of person features. Second, a graph convolutional network (GCN) based multi-domain information fusion (MDIF) module is developed, which minimizes domain distances by fusing features of different domains.

The existing datasets mostly label only one of the facets for model training, resulting in the video representation that biases to only one facet depending on the training dataset. There is no study yet on how to learn a video representation from multifaceted labels, and whether multifaceted information is helpful for video representation learning. In this paper, we propose a new learning framework, MUlti-Faceted Integration (MUFI), to aggregate facets from different datasets for learning a representation that could reflect the full spectrum of video content. Technically, MUFI formulates the problem as visual-semantic embedding learning, which explicitly maps video representation into a rich semantic embedding space, and jointly optimizes video representation from two perspectives. One is to capitalize on the intra-facet supervision between each video and its own label descriptions, and the second predicts the ""semantic representation"" of each video from the facets of other datasets as the inter-facet supervision. Extensive experiments demonstrate that learning 3D CNN via our MUFI framework on a union of four large-scale video datasets plus two image datasets leads to superior capability of video representation. The pre-learnt 3D CNN with MUFI also shows clear improvements over other approaches on several downstream video applications.

Previous work focuses on developing segmentation or classification methods only for certain mass types. Differential diagnosis of all mass types is clinically highly desirable [20] but has not been investigated using an automated image understanding approach. We exploit the feasibility to distinguish pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) from the nine other nonPDAC masses using multi-phase CT imaging. Both image appearance and the 3D organ-mass geometry relationship are critical. We propose a holistic segmentation-mesh-classification network (SMCN) to provide patient-level diagnosis, by fully utilizing the geometry and location information, which is accomplished by combining the anatomical structure and the semantic detection-by-segmentation network. SMCN learns the pancreas and mass segmentation task and builds an anatomical correspondence-aware organ mesh model by progressively deforming a pancreas prototype on the raw segmentation mask (i.e., mask-to-mesh). A new graph-based residual convolutional network (Graph-ResNet), whose nodes fuse the information of the mesh model and feature vectors extracted from the segmentation network, is developed to produce the patient-level differential classification results. Extensive experiments on 661 patients' CT scans (five phases per patient) show that SMCN can improve the mass segmentation and detection accuracy compared to the strong baseline method nnUNet (e.g., for nonPDAC, Dice: 0.611 vs. 0.478; detection rate: 89% vs. 70%), achieve similar sensitivity and specificity in differentiating PDAC and nonPDAC as expert radiologists (i.e., 94% and 90%), and obtain results comparable to a multimodality test [20] that combines clinical, imaging, and molecular testing for clinical management of patients.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Zhao_3D_Graph_Anatomy_Geometry-Integrated_Network_for_Pancreatic_Mass_Segmentation_Diagnosis_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Today's sensors cannot record this dynamic range in a single shot. Instead, HDR cameras acquire multiple measurements with different exposures, gains and photodiodes, from which an Image Signal Processor (ISP) reconstructs an HDR image. HDR image recovery for dynamic scenes is an open challenge because of motion and because stitched captures have different noise characteristics, resulting in artefacts that the ISP has to resolve---in real time and at triple-digit megapixel resolutions. Traditionally, hardware ISP settings used by downstream vision modules have been chosen by domain experts. Such frozen camera designs are then used for training data acquisition and supervised learning of downstream vision modules. We depart from this paradigm and formulate HDR ISP hyperparameter search as an end-to-end optimization problem. We propose a mixed 0th and 1st-order block coordinate descent optimizer to jointly learn ISP and detector network weights using RAW image data augmented with emulated SNR transition region artefacts.

A recent pioneering work employed knowledge distillation to reduce the dependency of human parsing, where the try-on images produced by a parser-based method are used as supervisions to train a ""student"" network without relying on segmentation, making the student mimic the try-on ability of the parser-based model. However, the image quality of the student is bounded by the parser-based model.

However, its principle of adding an extra path to encode spatial information is time-consuming, and the backbones borrowed from pretrained tasks, e.g., image classification, may be inefficient for image segmentation due to the deficiency of task-specific design. To handle these problems, we propose a novel and efficient structure named Short-Term Dense Concatenate network (STDC network) by removing structure redundancy. Specifically, we gradually reduce the dimension of feature maps and use the aggregation of them for image representation, which forms the basic module of STDC network. In the decoder, we propose a Detail Aggregation module by integrating the learning of spatial information into low-level layers in single-stream manner. Finally, the low-level features and deep features are fused to predict the final segmentation results. Extensive experiments on Cityscapes and CamVid dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by achieving promising trade-off between segmentation accuracy and inference speed.

However, compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using TT/TR always suffers significant accuracy loss. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for tensor decomposition-based model compression using Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM). By formulating TT decomposition-based model compression to an optimization problem with constraints on tensor ranks, we leverage ADMM technique to systemically solve this optimization problem in an iterative way. During this procedure, the entire DNN model is trained in the original structure instead of TT format, but gradually enjoys the desired low tensor rank characteristics. We then decompose this uncompressed model to TT format and fine-tune it to finally obtain a high-accuracy TT-format DNN model. Our framework is very general, and it works for both CNNs and RNNs, and can be easily modified to fit other tensor decomposition approaches. We evaluate our proposed framework on different DNN models for image classification and video recognition tasks. Experimental results show that our ADMM-based TT-format models demonstrate very high compression performance with high accuracy.

To learn new task without forgetting, recently, the mask-based learning method (e.g. piggyback ) is proposed to address these issues by learning only a binary element-wise mask, while keeping the backbone model fixed. However, the binary mask has limited modeling capacity for new tasks. A more recent work proposes a compress-grow-based method (CPG) to achieve better accuracy for new tasks by partially training backbone model, but with order-higher training cost, which makes it infeasible to be deployed into popular state-of-the-art edge-/mobile-learning.

This significantly reduces the computational cost without compromising the performance. Second, we introduce an attention layer to effectively harness the expressiveness of the equivariant features. While jointly trained with the network, the attention layer implicitly derives the intrinsic local frame in the feature space and generates attention vectors that can be integrated into different alignment tasks.

Our two-pass checkerboard context calculation eliminates such limitations on spatial locations by re-organizing the decoding order.

Zero-Shot Adversarial Quantization,"Yuang Liu, Wei Zhang, Jun Wang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 1512-1521","Model quantization is a promising approach to compress deep neural networks and accelerate inference, making it possible to be deployed on mobile and edge devices. To retain the high performance of full-precision models, most existing quantization methods focus on fine-tuning quantized model by assuming training datasets are accessible. However, this assumption sometimes is not satisfied in real situations due to data privacy and security issues, thereby making these quantization methods not applicable. To achieve zero-short model quantization without accessing training data, a tiny number of quantization methods adopt either post-training quantization or batch normalization statistics-guided data generation for fine-tuning. However, both of them inevitably suffer from low performance, since the former is a little too empirical and lacks training support for ultra-low precision quantization, while the latter could not fully restore the peculiarities of original data and is often low efficient for diverse data generation. To address the above issues, we propose a zero-shot adversarial quantization (ZAQ) framework, facilitating effective discrepancy estimation and knowledge transfer from a full-precision model to its quantized model. This is achieved by a novel two-level discrepancy modeling to drive a generator to synthesize informative and diverse data examples to optimize the quantized model in an adversarial learning fashion. We conduct extensive experiments on three fundamental vision tasks, demonstrating the superiority of ZAQ over the strong zero-shot baselines and validating the effectiveness of its main components.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Liu_Zero-Shot_Adversarial_Quantization_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

However, existing works on adversarial robustness mainly focus on balanced datasets, while real-world data usually exhibits a long-tailed distribution. To push adversarial robustness towards more realistic scenarios, in this work we investigate the adversarial vulnerability as well as defense under long-tailed distributions. In particular, we first reveal the negative impacts induced by imbalanced data on both recognition performance and adversarial robustness, uncovering the intrinsic challenges of this problem. We then perform a systematic study on existing long-tailed recognition methods in conjunction with the adversarial training framework. Several valuable observations are obtained: 1) natural accuracy is relatively easy to improve, 2) fake gain of robust accuracy exists under unreliable evaluation, and 3) boundary error limits the promotion of robustness. Inspired by these observations, we propose a clean yet effective framework, RoBal, which consists of two dedicated modules, a scale-invariant classifier and data re-balancing via both margin engineering at training stage and boundary adjustment during inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach over other state-of-the-art defense methods.

Several recent successful methods for training deep neural networks (DNNs) robust to label noise have used two primary techniques: filtering samples based on loss during a warm-up phase to curate an initial set of cleanly labeled samples, and using the output of a network as a pseudo-label for subsequent loss calculations. In this paper, we evaluate different augmentation strategies for algorithms tackling the """"learning with noisy labels"""" problem. We propose and examine multiple augmentation strategies and evaluate them using synthetic datasets based on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, as well as on the real-world dataset Clothing1M.

The large images are usually decomposed into small sub-images in practical usages. Based on this processing, we found that different image regions have different restoration difficulties and can be processed by networks with different capacities. Intuitively, smooth areas are easier to super-solve than complex textures. To utilize this property, we can adopt appropriate SR networks to process different sub-images after the decomposition. On this basis, we propose a new solution pipeline -- ClassSR that combines classification and SR in a unified framework. In particular, it first uses a Class-Module to classify the sub-images into different classes according to restoration difficulties, then applies an SR-Module to perform SR for different classes. The Class-Module is a conventional classification network, while the SR-Module is a network container that consists of the to-be-accelerated SR network and its simplified versions. We further introduce a new classification method with two losses -- Class-Loss and Average-Loss to produce the classification results. After joint training, a majority of sub-images will pass through smaller networks, thus the computational cost can be significantly reduced.

Our solution relies on designing a partitioner that breaks the space into smaller regions, each having a simpler distribution, and training a different generator for each partition. This is done in an unsupervised manner without requiring any labels. We formulate two desired criteria for the space partitioner that aid the training of our mixture of generators: 1) to produce connected partitions and 2) provide a proxy of distance between partitions and data samples, along with a direction for reducing that distance. These criteria are developed to avoid producing samples from places with non-existent data density, and also facilitate training by providing additional direction to the generators. We develop theoretical constraints for a space partitioner to satisfy the above criteria. Guided by our theoretical analysis, we design an effective neural architecture for the space partitioner that empirically assures these conditions.

Since questions and concepts are unbalanced, this tends to favor models which exploit subtle training set statistics. Alternatively, naively introducing artificial distribution shifts between train and test splits is also not completely satisfying. First, the shifts do not reflect real-world tendencies, resulting in unsuitable models; second, since the shifts are handcrafted, trained models are specifically designed for this particular setting, and do not generalize to other configurations.

Disentangling Label Distribution for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition,"Youngkyu Hong, Seungju Han, Kwanghee Choi, Seokjun Seo, Beomsu Kim, Buru Chang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 6626-6636","The current evaluation protocol of long-tailed visual recognition trains the classification model on the long-tailed source label distribution and evaluates its performance on the uniform target label distribution. Such protocol has questionable practicality since the target may also be long-tailed. Therefore, we formulate long-tailed visual recognition as a label shift problem where the target and source label distributions are different. One of the significant hurdles in dealing with the label shift problem is the entanglement between the source label distribution and the model prediction. In this paper, we focus on disentangling the source label distribution from the model prediction. We first introduce a simple but overlooked baseline method that matches the target label distribution by post-processing the model prediction trained by the cross-entropy loss and the Softmax function. Although this method surpasses state-of-the-art methods on benchmark datasets, it can be further improved by directly disentangling the source label distribution from the model prediction in the training phase. Thus, we propose a novel method, LAbel distribution DisEntangling (LADE) loss based on the optimal bound of Donsker-Varadhan representation. LADE achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-100-LT, Places-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist 2018.

Conventional deep metric learning methods minimize a discriminative loss to enlarge interclass distances while suppressing intraclass variations, which might lead to inferior generalization performance since samples even from the same class may present diverse characteristics. This motivates the adoption of the ensemble technique to learn a number of sub-embeddings using different and diverse subtasks. However, most subtasks impose weaker or contradictory constraints, which essentially sacrifices the discrimination ability of each sub-embedding to improve the generalization ability of their combination. To achieve a better generalization ability without compromising, we propose to separate the sub-embeddings from direct supervisions from the subtasks and apply the losses on different composites of the sub-embeddings. We employ a set of learnable compositors to combine the sub-embeddings and use a self-reinforced loss to train the compositors, which serve as relays to distribute the diverse training signals to avoid destroying the discrimination ability.

Unsupervised Visual Attention and Invariance for Reinforcement Learning,"Xudong Wang, Long Lian, Stella X. Yu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 6677-6687","The vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved tremendous success. However, generalizing vision-based RL policy to unknown test environments still remains as a challenging problem. Unlike previous works that focus on training a universal RL policy that is invariant to discrepancies between test and training environment, we focus on developing an independent module to disperse interference factors irrelevant to the task, thereby providing """"clean"""" observations for the RL policy. The proposed unsupervised visual attention and invariance method (VAI) contains three key components: 1) an unsupervised keypoint detection model which captures semantically meaningful keypoints in observations; 2) an unsupervised visual attention module which automatically generates the distraction-invariant attention mask for each observation; 3) a self-supervised adapter for visual distraction invariance which reconstructs distraction-invariant attention mask from observations with artificial disturbances generated by a series of foreground and background augmentations. All components are optimized in an unsupervised way, without manual annotation or access to environment internals, and only the adapter is used during inference time to provide distraction-free observations to RL policy. VAI empirically shows powerful generalization capabilities and significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 15% 49% in DeepMind Control suite benchmark and 61% 229% in our proposed robot manipulation benchmark, in term of cumulative rewards per episode.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Wang_Unsupervised_Visual_Attention_and_Invariance_for_Reinforcement_Learning_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

This paper proposes the first Megapixel level method for one shot Face Swapping (or MegaFS for short). Firstly, MegaFS organizes face representation hierarchically by the proposed Hierarchical Representation Face Encoder (HieRFE) in an extended latent space to maintain more facial details, rather than compressed representation in previous face swapping methods. Secondly, a carefully designed Face Transfer Module (FTM) is proposed to transfer the identity from a source image to the target by a non-linear trajectory without explicit feature disentanglement. Finally, the swapped faces can be synthesized by StyleGAN2 with the benefits of its training stability and powerful generative capability. Each part of MegaFS can be trained separately so the requirement of our model for GPU memory can be satisfied for megapixel face swapping. In summary, complete face representation, stable training, and limited memory usage are the three novel contributions to the success of our method.

In this way, the kernel is built in a data-driven manner, endowing PAConv with more flexibility than 2D convolutions to better handle the irregular and unordered point cloud data.

We show that dense object detectors can achieve a more accurate ranking of candidate detections based on the IACS.

Despite the encouraging progress on RPM that achieves human-level performance in terms of accuracy, modern approaches have neither a treatment of human-like reasoning on generalization, nor a potential to generate answers. To fill in this gap, we propose a neuro-symbolic Probabilistic Abduction and Execution (PrAE) learner; central to the PrAE learner is the process of probabilistic abduction and execution on a probabilistic scene representation, akin to the mental manipulation of objects. Specifically, we disentangle perception and reasoning from a monolithic model. The neural visual perception frontend predicts objects' attributes, later aggregated by a scene inference engine to produce a probabilistic scene representation. In the symbolic logical reasoning backend, the PrAE learner uses the representation to abduce the hidden rules. An answer is predicted by executing the rules on the probabilistic representation.

One is to predict new positions in an incoming frame based on tracking information from previous frames, and the other is to enhance data association by generating more discriminative identity embeddings. Some works combined both directions within one framework but handled them as two individual tasks, thus gaining little mutual benefits. In this paper, we propose a novel unified model with synergy between position prediction and embedding association. The two tasks are linked by temporal-aware target attention and distractor attention, as well as identity-aware memory aggregation model. Specifically, the attention modules can make the prediction focus more on targets and less on distractors, therefore more reliable embeddings can be extracted accordingly for association. On the other hand, such reliable embeddings can boost identity-awareness through memory aggregation, hence strengthen attention modules and suppress drifts. In this way, the synergy between position prediction and embedding association is achieved, which leads to strong robustness to occlusions.

In this work, we discuss the problem of identifying these critical pathways and subsequently leverage them for interpreting the network's response to an input. The pruning objective --- selecting the smallest group of neurons for which the response remains equivalent to the original network --- has been previously proposed for identifying critical pathways. We demonstrate that sparse pathways derived from pruning do not necessarily encode critical input information. To ensure sparse pathways include critical fragments of the encoded input information, we propose pathway selection via neurons' contribution to the response. We proceed to explain how critical pathways can reveal critical input features. We prove that pathways selected via neuron contribution are locally linear (in an L2-ball), a property that we use for proposing a feature attribution method: ""pathway gradient"".

Rethinking and Improving the Robustness of Image Style Transfer,"Pei Wang, Yijun Li, Nuno Vasconcelos"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 124-133","Extensive research in neural style transfer methods has shown that the correlation between features extracted by a pre-trained VGG network has remarkable ability to capture the visual style of an image. Surprisingly, however, this stylization quality is not robust and often degrades significantly when applied to features from more advanced and lightweight networks, such as those in the ResNet family. By performing extensive experiments with different network architectures, we find that residual connections, which represent the main architectural difference between VGG and ResNet, produce feature maps of small entropy, which are not suitable for style transfer. To improve the robustness of the ResNet architecture, we then propose a simple yet effective solution based on a softmax transformation of the feature activations that enhances their entropy. Experimental results demonstrate that this small magic can greatly improve the quality of stylization results, even for networks with random weights. This suggests that the architecture used for feature extraction is more important than the use of learned weights for the task of style transfer.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Wang_Rethinking_and_Improving_the_Robustness_of_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Recent researches demonstrate that good feature embedding is the key to reach favorable few-shot learning performance.

In this paper, we introduce a novel cross-domain metric learning loss, which we dub Cross-Domain Triplet (CDT) loss, to improve face recognition in unseen domains. The CDT loss encourages learning semantically meaningful features by enforcing compact feature clusters of identities from one domain, where the compactness is measured by underlying similarity metrics that belong to another training domain with different statistics. Intuitively, it discriminatively correlates explicit metrics derived from one domain, with triplet samples from another domain in a unified loss function to be minimized within a network, which leads to better alignment of the training domains. The network parameters are further enforced to learn generalized features under domain shift, in a model-agnostic learning pipeline.

Despite significant progress has been made in recent years, texture-confusing situations like clothing changing and persons wearing the same clothes receive little attention from most existing ReID methods. In this paper, rather than relying on texture based information, we propose to improve the robustness of person ReID against clothing texture by exploiting the information of a person's 3D shape. Existing shape learning schemas for person ReID either ignore the 3D information of a person, or require extra physical devices to collect 3D source data. Differently, we propose a novel ReID learning framework that directly extracts a texture-insensitive 3D shape embedding from a 2D image by adding 3D body reconstruction as an auxiliary task and regularization, called 3D Shape Learning (3DSL). The 3D reconstruction based regularization forces the ReID model to decouple the 3D shape information from the visual texture, and acquire discriminative 3D shape ReID features. To solve the problem of lacking 3D ground truth, we design an adversarial self-supervised projection (ASSP) model, performing 3D reconstruction without ground truth.

However, training CNNs on a large-scale face recognition dataset with limited computational resources is still a challenge. This is because the classification paradigm needs to train a fully connected layer as the category classifier, and its parameters will be in the hundreds of millions if the training dataset contains millions of identities. This requires many computational resources, such as GPU memory. The metric learning paradigm is an economical computation method, but its performance is greatly inferior to that of the classification paradigm.

While the existing cycle-consistency loss ensures that the image can be translated back, our approach makes the model further preserve the attribute-irrelevant regions even in a single translation to another domain by using the Grad-CAM output computed from the discriminator. Our CAM-consistency loss directly optimizes such a Grad-CAM output from the discriminator during training, in order to properly capture which local regions the generator should change while keeping the other regions unchanged. In this manner, our approach allows the generator and the discriminator to collaborate with each other to improve the image translation quality. In our experiments, we validate the effectiveness and versatility of our proposed CAM-consistency loss by applying it to several representative models for facial image editing, such as StarGAN, AttGAN, and STGAN.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Kim_Not_Just_Compete_but_Collaborate_Local_Image-to-Image_Translation_via_Cooperative_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Behavior-Driven Synthesis of Human Dynamics,"Andreas Blattmann, Timo Milbich, Michael Dorkenwald, Bjorn Ommer"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 12236-12246","Generating and representing human behavior are of major importance for various computer vision applications. Commonly, human video synthesis represents behavior as sequences of postures while directly predicting their likely progressions or merely changing the appearance of the depicted persons, thus not being able to exercise control over their actual behavior during the synthesis process. In contrast, controlled behavior synthesis and transfer across individuals requires a deep understanding of body dynamics and calls for a representation of behavior that is independent of appearance and also of specific postures. In this work, we present a model for human behavior synthesis which learns a dedicated representation of human dynamics independent of postures. Using this representation, we are able to change the behavior of a person depicted in an arbitrary posture, or to even directly transfer behavior observed in a given video sequence. To this end, we propose a conditional variational framework which explicitly disentangles posture from behavior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on this novel task, evaluating capturing, transferring, and sampling fine-grained, diverse behavior, both quantitatively and qualitatively.

Different from the conventional digital cameras that compact the photoelectric information within the exposure interval into a single snapshot, the spike camera produces a continuous spike stream to record the dynamic light intensity variation process. For spike cameras, image reconstruction remains an important and challenging issue. To this end, this paper develops a spike-to-image neural network (Spk2ImgNet) to reconstruct the dynamic scene from the continuous spike stream. In particular, to handle the challenges brought by both noise and high-speed motion, we propose a hierarchical architecture to exploit the temporal correlation of the spike stream progressively. Firstly, a spatially adaptive light inference subnet is proposed to exploit the local temporal correlation, producing basic light intensity estimates of different moments. Then, a pyramid deformable alignment is utilized to align the intermediate features such that the feature fusion module can exploit the long-term temporal correlation, while avoiding undesired motion blur.

A Dual Iterative Refinement Method for Non-Rigid Shape Matching,"Rui Xiang, Rongjie Lai, Hongkai Zhao"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 15930-15939","In this work, a robust and efficient dual iterative refinement (DIR) method is proposed for dense correspondence between two nearly isometric shapes. The key idea is to use dual information, such as spatial and spectral, or local and global features, in a complementary and effective way, and extract more accurate information from current iteration to use for the next iteration. In each DIR iteration, starting from current correspondence, a zoom-in process at each point is used to select well matched anchor pairs by a local mapping distortion criterion. These selected anchor pairs are then used to align spectral features (or other appropriate global features) whose dimension adaptively matches the capacity of the selected anchor pairs.

In this paper, we investigate their combinations and propose a novel Non-Local Sparse Attention (NLSA) with dynamic sparse attention pattern. NLSA is designed to retain long-range modeling capability from NL operation while enjoying robustness and high-efficiency of sparse representation. Specifically, NLSA rectifies NL attention with spherical locality sensitive hashing (LSH) that partitions the input space into hash buckets of related features. For every query signal, NLSA assigns a bucket to it and only computes attention within the bucket. The resulting sparse attention prevents the model from attending to locations that are noisy and less-informative, while reducing the computational cost from quadratic to asymptotic linear with respect to the spatial size. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of NLSA. With a few non-local sparse attention modules, our architecture, called non-local sparse network (NLSN), reaches state-of-the-art performance for SISR quantitatively and qualitatively.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Mei_Image_Super-Resolution_With_Non-Local_Sparse_Attention_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Early methods rely on feature tracking to recover either 2D or 3D frame motion, which suffer from the robustness of local feature extraction and tracking in shaky videos. Recently, learning-based methods seek to find frame transformations with high-level information via deep neural networks to overcome the robustness issue of feature tracking. Nevertheless, to our best knowledge, no learning-based methods leverage 3D cues for the transformation inference yet; hence they would lead to artifacts on complex scene-depth scenarios. In this paper, we propose Deep3D Stabilizer, a novel 3D depth-based learning method for video stabilization. We take advantage of the recent self-supervised framework on jointly learning depth and camera ego-motion estimation on raw videos. Our approach requires no data for pre-training but stabilizes the input video via 3D reconstruction directly. The rectification stage incorporates the 3D scene depth and camera motion to smooth the camera trajectory and synthesize the stabilized video. Unlike most one-size-fits-all learning-based methods, our smoothing algorithm allows users to manipulate the stability of a video efficiently.

To bridge the gap, we conduct a first study to understand and predict the temporal sequences of eye fixations (a.k.a. scanpaths) during performing general tasks, and examine how scanpaths affect task performance. We present a new deep reinforcement learning method to predict scanpaths leading to different performances in visual question answering.

These avatars are driven by pose parameters and have realistic clothing that moves and deforms naturally. SCANimate does not rely on a customized mesh template or surface mesh registration. We observe that fitting a parametric 3D body model, like SMPL, to a clothed human scan is tractable while surface registration of the body topology to the scan is often not, because clothing can deviate significantly from the body shape. We also observe that articulated transformations are invertible, resulting in geometric cycle-consistency in the posed and unposed shapes. These observations lead us to a weakly supervised learning method that aligns scans into a canonical pose by disentangling articulated deformations without template-based surface registration. Furthermore, to complete missing regions in the aligned scans while modeling pose-dependent deformations, we introduce a locally pose-aware implicit function that learns to complete and model geometry with learned pose correctives. In contrast to commonly used global pose embeddings, our local pose conditioning significantly reduces long-range spurious correlations and improves generalization to unseen poses, especially when training data is limited. Our method can be applied to pose-aware appearance modeling to generate a fully textured avatar.

As a result, one often resorts to subjective quality assessment, the most straightforward and reliable means of evaluating image enhancement. Conventional subjective testing requires manually pre-selecting a small set of visual examples, which may suffer from three sources of biases: 1) sampling bias due to the extremely sparse distribution of the selected samples in the image space; 2) algorithmic bias due to potential overfitting the selected samples; 3) subjective bias due to further potential cherry-picking test results. This eventually makes the field of real-world image enhancement more of an art than a science. Here we take steps towards debiasing conventional subjective assessment by automatically sampling a set of adaptive and diverse images for subsequent testing. This is achieved by casting sample selection into a joint maximization of the discrepancy between the enhancers and the diversity among the selected input images. Careful visual inspection on the resulting enhanced images provides a debiased ranking of the enhancement algorithms. We demonstrate our subjective assessment method using three popular and practically demanding image enhancement tasks: dehazing, super-resolution, and low-light enhancement.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Cao_Debiased_Subjective_Assessment_of_Real-World_Image_Enhancement_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Neural Reprojection Error: Merging Feature Learning and Camera Pose Estimation,"Hugo Germain, Vincent Lepetit, Guillaume Bourmaud"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 414-423","Absolute camera pose estimation is usually addressed by sequentially solving two distinct subproblems: First a feature matching problem that seeks to establish putative 2D-3D correspondences, and then a Perspective-n-Point problem that minimizes, w.r.t. the camera pose, the sum of so-called Reprojection Errors (RE). We argue that generating putative 2D-3D correspondences 1) leads to an important loss of information that needs to be compensated as far as possible, within RE, through the choice of a robust loss and the tuning of its hyperparameters and 2) may lead to an RE that conveys erroneous data to the pose estimator. In this paper, we introduce the Neural Reprojection Error (NRE) as a substitute for RE. NRE allows to rethink the camera pose estimation problem by merging it with the feature learning problem, hence leveraging richer information than 2D-3D correspondences and eliminating the need for choosing a robust loss and its hyperparameters. Thus NRE can be used as training loss to learn image descriptors tailored for pose estimation. We also propose a coarse-to-fine optimization method able to very efficiently minimize a sum of NRE terms w.r.t. the camera pose. We experimentally demonstrate that NRE is a good substitute for RE as it significantly improves both the robustness and the accuracy of the camera pose estimate while being computationally and memory highly efficient.

Different from previous methods focusing on learning domain-invariant feature representations, some recent methods present generic semi-supervised learning (SSL) techniques and directly apply them to DA tasks, even achieving competitive performance. One of the most popular SSL techniques is pseudo-labeling that assigns pseudo labels for each unlabeled data via the classifier trained by labeled data. However, it ignores the distribution shift in DA problems and is inevitably biased to source data. To address this issue, we propose a new pseudo-labeling framework called Auxiliary Target Domain-Oriented Classifier (ATDOC).

Specifically, we employ the memory mechanism and develop two types of non-parametric classifiers, i.e. the nearest centroid classifier and neighborhood aggregation, without introducing any additional network parameters.

Previous methods suffer from inefficient category-level pose feature extraction, which leads to low accuracy and inference speed. To tackle this problem, we propose a fast shape-based network (FS-Net) with efficient category-level feature extraction for 6D pose estimation. First, we design an orientation aware autoencoder with 3D graph convolution for latent feature extraction. Thanks to the shift and scale-invariance properties of 3D graph convolution, the learned latent feature is insensitive to point shift and object size. Then, to efficiently decode category-level rotation information from the latent feature, we propose a novel decoupled rotation mechanism that employs two decoders to complementarily access the rotation information. For translation and size, we estimate them by two residuals: the difference between the mean of object points and ground truth translation, and the difference between the mean size of the category and ground truth size, respectively. Finally, to increase the generalization ability of the FS-Net, we propose an online box-cage based 3D deformation mechanism to augment the training data.

To address this problem, we present Cross-Iteration Batch Normalization (CBN), in which examples from multiple recent iterations are jointly utilized to enhance estimation quality. A challenge of computing statistics over multiple iterations is that the network activations from different iterations are not comparable to each other due to changes in network weights. We thus compensate for the network weight changes via a proposed technique based on Taylor polynomials, so that the statistics can be accurately estimated and batch normalization can be effectively applied.

An action sequence for a human-object interaction task is typically very complicated, involving the evolution of pose, person's appearance, object locations, and object appearances over time.

We address the challenge of creating large varieties of high-resolution and detailed 3D geometry from a small set of exemplars by treating the problem as that of geometric detail transfer. Given a low-resolution coarse voxel shape, our network refines it, via voxel upsampling, into a higher-resolution shape enriched with geometric details. The output shape preserves the overall structure (or content) of the input, while its detail generation is conditioned on an input ""style code"" corresponding to a detailed exemplar. Our 3D detailization via conditional refinement is realized by a generative adversarial network, coined DECOR-GAN.

As a matter of fact, AU semantic descriptions provide much more information than the binary AU labels alone, thus we propose to exploit the Semantic Embedding and Visual feature (SEV-Net) for AU detection.

However, the latent domain gap between the cross-modal data could lead to an learning ambiguity and thus limits the performance of lip reading. In this paper, we propose a novel collaborative framework for lip reading, and two aspects of issues are considered: 1) the teacher should understand bi-modal knowledge to possibly bridge the inherent cross-modal gap; 2) the teacher should adjust teaching contents adaptively with the evolution of the student. To these ends, we introduce a trainable ""master"" network which ingests both audio signals and silent lip videos instead of a pretrained teacher. The master produces logits from three modalities of features: audio modality, video modality, and their combination. To further provide an interactive strategy to fuse these knowledge organically, we regularize the master with the task-specific feedback from the student, in which the requirement of the student is implicitly embedded. Meanwhile we involve a couple of ""tutor"" networks into our system as guidance for emphasizing the fruitful knowledge flexibly.

Existing methods often learn the classification task by optimizing each proposal separately and neglect the relationship among different proposals. Such detection paradigm also encounters the mismatch between classification and localization due to the inherent discrepancy of their optimization targets. In this work, we propose a ranking-based optimization algorithm for harmoniously learning to rank and localize proposals in lieu of the classification task. To this end, we comprehensively investigate three types of ranking constraints, i.e., global ranking, class-specific ranking and IoU-guided ranking losses. The global ranking loss encourages foreground samples to rank higher than background. The class-specific ranking loss ensures that positive samples rank higher than negative ones for each specific class. The IoU-guided ranking loss aims to align each pair of confidence scores with the associated pair of IoU overlap between two positive samples of a specific class. Our ranking constraints can sufficiently explore the relationships between samples from three different perspectives. They are easy-to-implement, compatible with mainstream detection frameworks and computation-free for inference. Experiments demonstrate that our RankDetNet consistently surpasses prior anchor-based and anchor-free baselines, e.g., improving RetinaNet baseline by 2.5% AP on the COCO test-dev set without bells and whistles.

In particular, we take one step further and exploit the feature distances from prototypes that provide richer information than mere prototypes. Specifically, we use it to estimate the likelihood of pseudo labels to facilitate online correction in the course of training. Meanwhile, we align the prototypical assignments based on relative feature distances for two different views of the same target, producing a more compact target feature space.

The philosophy of off-the-shelf approaches lies in the augmentation of unpaired data, i.e. first generating synthetic low-resolution (LR) images Y^g corresponding to real-world high-resolution (HR) images X^r in the real-world LR domain Y^r, and then utilizing the pseudo pairs Y^g, X^r for training in a supervised manner. Unfortunately, since image translation itself is an extremely challenging task, the SR performance of these approaches is severely limited by the domain gap between generated synthetic LR images and real LR images. In this paper, we propose a novel domain-distance aware super-resolution (DASR) approach for unsupervised real-world image SR. The domain gap between training data (e.g. Y^g) and testing data (e.g. Y^r) is addressed with our domain-gap aware training and domain-distance weighted supervision strategies.

Yu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 12586-12595","Unsupervised feature learning has made great strides with contrastive learning based on instance discrimination and invariant mapping, as benchmarked on curated class-balanced datasets. However, natural data could be highly correlated and long-tail distributed. Natural between-instance similarity conflicts with the presumed instance distinction, causing unstable training and poor performance. Our idea is to discover and integrate between-instance similarity into contrastive learning, not directly by instance grouping, but by cross-level discrimination (CLD) between instances and local instance groups. While invariant mapping of each instance is imposed by attraction within its augmented views, between-instance similarity emerges from common repulsion against instance groups. Our batch-wise and cross-view comparisons also greatly improve the positive/negative sample ratio of contrastive learning and achieve better invariant mapping. To effect both grouping and discrimination objectives, we impose them on features separately derived from a shared representation. In addition, we propose normalized projection heads and unsupervised hyper-parameter tuning for the first time. Our extensive experimentation demonstrates that CLD is a lean and powerful add-on to existing methods (e.g., NPID, MoCo, InfoMin, BYOL) on highly correlated, long-tail, or balanced datasets. It not only achieves new state-of-the-art on self-supervision, semi-supervision, and transfer learning benchmarks, but also beats MoCo v2 and SimCLR on every reported performance attained with a much larger compute.

Therefore, this paper proposes a unified, multi-task framework to jointly handle these two tasks, termed MTLFace, which can learn age-invariant identity-related representation while achieving pleasing face synthesis. Specifically, we first decompose the mixed face features into two uncorrelated components---identity- and age-related features---through an attention mechanism, and then decorrelate these two components using multi-task training and continuous domain adaption. In contrast to the conventional one-hot encoding that achieves group-level FAS, we propose a novel identity conditional module to achieve identity-level FAS, with a weight-sharing strategy to improve the age smoothness of synthesized faces. In addition, we collect and release a large cross-age face dataset with age and gender annotations to advance AIFR and FAS. Extensive experiments on five benchmark cross-age datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed MTLFace over state-of-the-art methods for AIFR and FAS.

It takes as input the historical pose tracklets and directly predicts the corresponding poses in the following frame for each tracklet. The predicted poses will then be aggregated with the detected poses, if any, at the same frame so as to produce the final pose, potentially recovering the occluded joints missed by the estimator.

Specifically, the set is defined as a subset of points in the target contour, and our goal is to track corresponding points on the target contour. Those outputs enable us to apply various visual effects such as motion tracking, part deformation, and texture mapping. To this end, we propose a new method to track the corresponding points between frames by the global-local alignment with delicately designed losses and regularization terms. We also introduce a novel learning strategy using synthetic and VOS datasets that makes it possible to tackle the problem without developing the point correspondence dataset. Since the existing datasets are not suitable to validate our method, we build a new polygonal point set tracking dataset and demonstrate the superior performance of our method over the baselines and existing contour-based VOS methods.

For evaluation, we proposed a new metric, IDEucl, to measure an algorithm's efficacy in preserving a unique identity for the longest stretch in image coordinate space, thus building a correspondence between pedestrian crowd motion and the performance of a tracking algorithm. Moreover, we also propose a new head detector, HeadHunter, which is designed for small head detection in crowded scenes. We extend HeadHunter with a Particle Filter and a color histogram based re-identification module for head tracking. To establish this as a strong baseline, we compare our tracker with existing state-of-the-art pedestrian trackers on CroHD and demonstrate superiority, especially in identity preserving tracking metrics.

Many recent trackers adopt the multiple-stage tracking strategy to improve the quality of bounding box estimation. These methods first coarsely locate the target and then refine the initial prediction in the following stages. However, existing approaches still suffer from limited precision, and the coupling of different stages severely restricts the method's transferability. This work proposes a novel, flexible, and accurate refinement module called Alpha-Refine (AR), which can significantly improve the base trackers' box estimation quality. By exploring a series of design options, we conclude that the key to successful refinement is extracting and maintaining detailed spatial information as much as possible. Following this principle, Alpha-Refine adopts a pixel-wise correlation, a corner prediction head, and an auxiliary mask head as the core components. Comprehensive experiments on TrackingNet, LaSOT, GOT-10K, and VOT2020 benchmarks with multiple base trackers show that our approach significantly improves the base trackers' performance with little extra latency. The proposed Alpha-Refine method leads to a series of strengthened trackers, among which the ARSiamRPN (AR strengthened SiamRPNpp) and the ARDiMP50 (ARstrengthened DiMP50) achieve good efficiency-precision trade-off, while the ARDiMPsuper (AR strengthened DiMP-super) achieves very competitive performance at a real-time speed.

However, most of these successes are limited to a specific dataset and cannot generalize well to other datasets. The main difficulties lie in the large domain differences and unbalanced disparity distribution across a variety of datasets, which greatly limit the real-world applicability of current deep stereo matching models. In this paper, we propose CFNet, a Cascade and Fused cost volume based network to improve the robustness of the stereo matching network. First, we propose a fused cost volume representation to deal with the large domain difference. By fusing multiple low-resolution dense cost volumes to enlarge the receptive field, we can extract robust structural representations for initial disparity estimation. Second, we propose a cascade cost volume representation to alleviate the unbalanced disparity distribution. Specifically, we employ a variance-based uncertainty estimation to adaptively adjust the next stage disparity search space, in this way driving the network progressively prune out the space of unlikely correspondences. By iteratively narrowing down the disparity search space and improving the cost volume resolution, the disparity estimation is gradually refined in a coarse-to-fine manner.

However, existing works focus on parsing either the objects (e.g. cars and pedestrians) or scenes (e.g. trees and buildings) from the LiDAR sensor. In this work, we address the task of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, which aims to parse both objects and scenes in a unified manner. As one of the first endeavors towards this new challenging task, we propose the Dynamic Shifting Network (DS-Net), which serves as an effective panoptic segmentation framework in the point cloud realm. In particular, DS-Net has three appealing properties: 1) strong backbone design. DS-Net adopts the cylinder convolution that is specifically designed for LiDAR point clouds. The extracted features are shared by the semantic branch and the instance branch which operates in a bottom-up clustering style. 2) Dynamic Shifting for complex point distributions. We observe that commonly-used clustering algorithms like BFS or DBSCAN are incapable of handling complex autonomous driving scenes with non-uniform point cloud distributions and varying instance sizes. Thus, we present an efficient learnable clustering module, dynamic shifting, which adapts kernel functions on-the-fly for different instances. 3) Consensus-driven Fusion. Finally, consensus-driven fusion is used to deal with the disagreement between semantic and instance predictions. To comprehensively evaluate the performance of LiDAR-based panoptic segmentation, we construct and curate benchmarks from two large-scale autonomous driving LiDAR datasets, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes.

Recently, continuous efforts have been devoted to addressing this issue, which has achieved remarkable progress. However, the existing work is seriously limited by complete observation, that is, once the historical motion sequence is incomplete (with missing values), it can only produce unexpected predictions or even deformities. Furthermore, due to inevitable reasons such as occlusion and the lack of equipment precision, the incompleteness of motion data occurs frequently, which hinders the practical application of current algorithms. In this work, we first notice this challenging problem, i.e., how to generate high-fidelity human motion predictions from incomplete observations. To solve it, we propose a novel multi-task graph convolutional network (MT-GCN). Specifically, the model involves two branches, in which the primary task is to focus on forecasting future 3D human actions accurately, while the auxiliary one is to repair the missing value of the incomplete observation. Both of them are integrated into a unified framework to share the spatio-temporal representation, which improves the final performance of each collaboratively.

However, most of them require re-training or re-adaption for a new scene and have difficulties in handling large-scale scenes due to limited network capacity. We present a new method for scene agnostic camera localization using dense scene matching (DSM), where the cost volume is constructed between a query image and a scene. The cost volume and the corresponding coordinates are processed by a CNN to predict dense coordinates. Camera poses can then be solved by PnP algorithms. In addition, our method can be extended to temporal domain, giving extra performance boost during testing time.

For this purpose, the FIQA method should consider both the intrinsic property and the recognizability of the face image. Most previous works aim to estimate the sample-wise embedding uncertainty or pair-wise similarity as the quality score, which only considers the partial information from the intra-class. However, these methods ignore the valuable information from the inter-class, which is for estimating the recognizability of face image. In this work, we argue that a high-quality face image should be similar to its intra-class samples and dissimilar to its inter-class samples. Thus, we propose a novel unsupervised FIQA method that incorporates Similarity Distribution Distance for Face Image Quality Assessment (SDD-FIQA). Our method generates quality pseudo-labels by calculating the Wasserstein Distance (WD) between the intra-class and inter-class similarity distributions. With these quality pseudo-labels, we are capable of training a regression network for quality prediction.

Existing video based deraining method focus only on rain streak removal, and commonly use optical flow to align the rain video frames. However, besides rain streaks, rain accummulation can considerably degrade visibility; and, optical flow estimation in a rain video is still erroneous, making the deraining performance tend to be inaccurate. Our method employs deformable convolution layers in our encoder to achieve feature-level frame alignment, and hence avoids using optical flow. For rain streaks, our method predicts the current frame from its adjacent frames, such that rain streaks that appear randomly in the temporal domain can be removed. For rain accumulation, our method employs transmission-depth consistency to resolve the ambiguity between the depth and water-droplet density. Our network estimates the depth from consecutive rain-accumulation-removal outputs, and we calculate the transmission map using a commonly used physics model. To ensure photometric-temporal and depth-temporal consistencies, our network also estimate the camera poses, so that we can warp one frame to its adjacent frames.

Traditional approaches often rely on heavily engineered pipelines that require accurate manual initialization of human poses and tedious post-processing. More recently, learning-based methods are proposed in hope to automate this process. We observe that pose initialization is key to accurate registration but existing methods often fail to provide accurate pose initialization. One major obstacle is that, despite recent effort on rotation representation learning in neural networks, regressing joint rotations from point clouds or images of humans is still very challenging. To this end, we propose novel piecewise transformation fields (PTF), a set of functions that learn 3D translation vectors to map any query point in posed space to its correspond position in rest-pose space. We combine PTF with multi-class occupancy networks, obtaining a novel learning-based framework that learns to simultaneously predict shape and per-point correspondences between the posed space and the canonical space for clothed human. Our key insight is that the translation vector for each query point can be effectively estimated using the point-aligned local features; consequently, rigid per bone transformations and joint rotations can be obtained efficiently via a least-square fitting given the estimated point correspondences, circumventing the challenging task of directly regressing joint rotations from neural networks. Furthermore, the proposed PTF facilitate canonicalized occupancy estimation, which greatly improves generalization capability and result in more accurate surface reconstruction with only half of the parameters compared with the state-of-the-art.

Almost all popular Siamese trackers realize the similarity learning via convolutional feature cross-correlation between a target branch and a search branch. However, since the size of target feature region needs to be pre-fixed, these cross-correlation base methods suffer from either reserving much adverse background information or missing a great deal of foreground information. Moreover, the global matching between the target and search region also largely neglects the target structure and part-level information. In this paper, to solve the above issues, we propose a simple target-aware Siamese graph attention network for general object tracking. We propose to establish part-to-part correspondence between the target and the search region with a complete bipartite graph, and apply the graph attention mechanism to propagate target information from the template feature to the search feature.

In this paper, we propose a Rotation-equivariant Detector (ReDet) to address these issues, which explicitly encodes rotation equivariance and rotation invariance. More precisely, we incorporate rotation-equivariant networks into the detector to extract rotation-equivariant features, which can accurately predict the orientation and lead to a huge reduction of model size.

The challenge is that the labeled and unlabeled examples are from non-overlapping classes, which makes it difficult to build a learning relationship between them. In this work, we introduce OpenMix to mix the unlabeled examples from an open set and the labeled examples from known classes, where their non-overlapping labels and pseudo-labels are simultaneously mixed into a joint label distribution. OpenMix dynamically compounds examples in two ways. First, we produce mixed training images by incorporating labeled examples with unlabeled examples. With the benefit of unique prior knowledge in novel class discovery, the generated pseudo-labels will be more credible than the original unlabeled predictions. As a result, OpenMix helps preventing the model from overfitting on unlabeled samples that may be assigned with wrong pseudo-labels. Second, the first way encourages the unlabeled examples with high class-probabilities to have considerable accuracy. We introduce these examples as reliable anchors and further integrate them with unlabeled samples. This enables us to generate more combinations in unlabeled examples and exploit finer object relations among the new classes.

In this paper, we propose a novel method to obtain a bispectral difference image using an event camera with temporally modulated illumination. Our method is rooted in a key observation on the analogy between the bispectral photometry principle of the participating medium and the event generating mechanism in an event camera. By carefully modulating the bispectral illumination, our method allows to read out the bispectral difference directly from triggered events.

One popular method is to obtain pseudo-label by clustering and use them to optimize the model. Although this kind of approach has shown promising accuracy, it is hampered by 1) noisy labels produced by clustering and 2) feature variations caused by camera shift. The former will lead to incorrect optimization and thus hinders the model accuracy. The latter will result in assigning the intra-class samples of different cameras to different pseudo-label, making the model sensitive to camera variations. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to solve both problems. Concretely, we propose a Dynamic and Symmetric Cross-Entropy loss (DSCE) to deal with noisy samples and a camera-aware meta-learning algorithm (MetaCam) to adapt camera shift. DSCE can alleviate the negative effects of noisy samples and accommodate the change of clusters after each clustering step. MetaCam simulates cross-camera constraint by splitting the training data into meta-train and meta-test based on camera IDs. With the interacted gradient from meta-train and meta-test, the model is enforced to learn camera-invariant features.

To overcome this challenge, an ideal model should be able to seek valuable, extra clues from the given scene and incorporate them into a joint learning framework for representation co-enhancement. With this inspiration, we design a novel Mutual Graph Learning (MGL) model, which generalizes the idea of conventional mutual learning from regular grids to the graph domain. Specifically, MGL decouples an image into two task-specific feature maps -- one for roughly locating the target and the other for accurately capturing its boundary details -- and fully exploits the mutual benefits by recurrently reasoning their high-order relations through graphs. Importantly, in contrast to most mutual learning approaches that use a shared function to model all between-task interactions, MGL is equipped with typed functions for handling different complementary relations to maximize information interactions.

Those sensors are more expensive than visual (RGB) sensors, and usually produce images with lower resolution. To this end, Cross-Modality Super-Resolution methods were introduced, where an RGB image of a high-resolution assists in increasing the resolution of a low-resolution modality. However, fusing images from different modalities is not a trivial task, since each multi-modal pair varies greatly in its internal correlations. For this reason, traditional state-of-the-arts which are trained on external datasets often struggle with yielding an artifact-free result that is still loyal to the target modality characteristics. We present CMSR, a single-pair approach for Cross-Modality Super-Resolution. The network is internally trained on the two input images only, in a self-supervised manner, learns their internal statistics and correlations, and applies them to upsample the target modality. CMSR contains an internal transformer which is trained on-the-fly together with the up-sampling process itself and without supervision, to allow dealing with pairs that are only weakly aligned.

To address this, we introduce a novel approach for more accurate and efficient spatio-temporal segmentation. In particular, to address instance discrimination, we propose to combine foreground region estimation and instance grouping together in one network, and additionally introduce temporal guidance for segmenting each frame, enabling more accurate object discovery. For temporal association, we complement current video object segmentation architectures with a discriminative appearance model, capable of capturing more fine-grained target-specific information. Given object proposals from the instance discrimination network, three essential strategies are adopted to achieve accurate segmentation: 1) target-specific tracking using a memory-augmented appearance model; 2) target-agnostic verification to trace possible tracklets for the proposal; 3) adaptive memory updating using the verified segments.

To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a transformer-based feature extractor, in which an attention mechanism and query-based detection play key roles. The attention mechanism is effective in aggregating contextually important information image-wide, while the queries, which we design in such a way that each query captures at most one human-object pair, can avoid mixing up the features from multiple instances. This transformer-based feature extractor produces so effective embeddings that the subsequent detection heads may be fairly simple and intuitive.

The Human Similarity Judgments extension to ImageNet (ImageNet-HSJ) is composed of a large set of human similarity judgments that supplements the existing ILSVRC validation set. The new dataset supports a range of task and performance metrics, including evaluation of unsupervised algorithms. We demonstrate two methods of assessment: using the similarity judgments directly and using a psychological embedding trained on the similarity judgments. This embedding space contains an order of magnitude more points (i.e., images) than previous efforts based on human judgments. We were able to scale to the full 50,000 image ILSVRC validation set through a selective sampling process that used variational Bayesian inference and model ensembles to sample aspects of the embedding space that were most uncertain. To demonstrate the utility of ImageNet-HSJ, we used the similarity ratings and the embedding space to evaluate how well several popular models conform to human similarity judgments. One finding is that more complex models that perform better on task-specific benchmarks do not better conform to human semantic judgments.

While extensive research efforts are devoted to improving compression techniques, every method inevitably discards information. Especially at low bit rates, this information often corresponds to semantically meaningful visual cues, so that decompression involves significant ambiguity. In spite of this fact, existing decompression algorithms typically produce only a single output, and do not allow the viewer to explore the set of images that map to the given compressed code. In this work we propose the first image decompression method to facilitate user-exploration of the diverse set of natural images that could have given rise to the compressed input code, thus granting users the ability to determine what could and what could not have been there in the original scene.

The state-of-the-art methods often rely on context modeling methods such as pictorial structure model (PSM) or graph neural network (GNN) to reduce ambiguity. However, there is no study that rigorously compares them side by side. So we first present a general formula for context modeling in which both PSM and GNN are its special cases. By comparing the two methods, we found that the end-to-end training scheme in GNN and the limb length constraints in PSM are two complementary factors to improve results. To combine their advantages, we propose ContextPose based on attention mechanism that allows enforcing soft limb length constraints in a deep network. The approach effectively reduces the chance of getting absurd 3D pose estimates with incorrect limb lengths and achieves state-of-the-art results on two benchmark datasets. More importantly, the introduction of limb length constraints into deep networks enables the approach to achieve much better generalization performance.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Ma_Context_Modeling_in_3D_Human_Pose_Estimation_A_Unified_Perspective_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Less Is More: ClipBERT for Video-and-Language Learning via Sparse Sampling,"Jie Lei, Linjie Li, Luowei Zhou, Zhe Gan, Tamara L. Berg, Mohit Bansal, Jingjing Liu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 7331-7341","The canonical approach to video-and-language learning (e.g., video question answering) dictates a neural model to learn from offline-extracted dense video features from vision models and text features from language models. These feature extractors are trained independently and usually on tasks different from the target domains, rendering these fixed features sub-optimal for downstream tasks. Moreover, due to the high computational overload of dense video features, it is often difficult (or infeasible) to plug feature extractors directly into existing approaches for easy finetuning. To provide a remedy to this dilemma, we propose a generic framework CLIPBERT that enables affordable end-to-end learning for video-and-language tasks, by employing sparse sampling, where only a single or a few sparsely sampled short clips from a video are used at each training step. Experiments on text-to-video retrieval and video question answering on six datasets demonstrate that CLIPBERT outperforms (or is on par with) existing methods that exploit full-length videos, suggesting that end-to-end learning with just a few sparsely sampled clips is often more accurate than using densely extracted offline features from full-length videos, proving the proverbial less-is-more principle. Videos in the datasets are from considerably different domains and lengths, ranging from 3-second generic-domain GIF videos to 180-second YouTube human activity videos, showing the generalization ability of our approach.

As a common practice, most existing methods predict LQE scores through vanilla convolutional features shared with object classification or bounding box regression. In this paper, we explore a completely novel and different perspective to perform LQE -- based on the learned distributions of the four parameters of the bounding box. The bounding box distributions are inspired and introduced as ""General Distribution"" in GFLV1, which describes the uncertainty of the predicted bounding boxes well. Such a property makes the distribution statistics of a bounding box highly correlated to its real localization quality. Specifically, a bounding box distribution with a sharp peak usually corresponds to high localization quality, and vice versa. By leveraging the close correlation between distribution statistics and the real localization quality, we develop a considerably lightweight Distribution-Guided Quality Predictor (DGQP) for reliable LQE based on GFLV1, thus producing GFLV2. To our best knowledge, it is the first attempt in object detection to use a highly relevant, statistical representation to facilitate LQE.

Pseudo labeling expands the number of ""labeled"" samples in each class in the target domain, and thus produces a more robust and powerful cluster core for each class to facilitate adversarial learning.

We propose a Deeply Shape-guided Cascade (DSC) for instance segmentation, which iteratively imposes the shape guidances extracted from mask prediction at previous stage on bounding box detection at current stage. It forms a bi-directional relationship between the two tasks by introducing three key components: (1) Initial shape guidance: A mask-supervised Region Proposal Network (mPRN) with the ability to generate class-agnostic masks; (2) Explicit shape guidance: A mask-guided region-of-interest (RoI) feature extractor, which employs mask segmentation at previous stage to focus feature extraction at current stage within a region aligned well with the shape of the instance-of-interest rather than a rectangular RoI; (3) Implicit shape guidance: A feature fusion operation which feeds intermediate mask features at previous stage to the bounding box head at current stage. Experimental results show that DSC outperforms the state-of-the-art instance segmentation cascade, Hybrid Task Cascade (HTC), by a large margin and achieves 51.8 box AP and 45.5 mask AP on COCO test-dev.

Our method, named MetricOpt, operates in a black-box setting where the computational details of the target metric are unknown. We achieve this by learning a differentiable value function, which maps compact task-specific model parameters to metric observations. The learned value function is easily pluggable into existing optimizers like SGD and Adam, and is effective for rapidly finetuning a pre-trained model. This leads to consistent improvements since the value function provides effective metric supervision during finetuning, and helps to correct the potential bias of loss-only supervision. MetricOpt achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of metrics for (image) classification, image retrieval and object detection.

This paper alleviates the restrictive assumptions in existing methods. We show that the problem becomes well-posed for a surface with a uniform chromaticity but spatially-varying albedos based on our new formulation. Specifically, if at least three (or two) scene points share the same chromaticity, the proposed method uniquely recovers their surface normals and spectral reflectance with the illumination of more than or equal to four (or five) spectral lights. Besides, our method can be made robust by having many (i.e., 4 or more) spectral bands using robust estimation techniques for conventional photometric stereo.

One promising direction is to perform few-shot human motion transfer, which only needs a few of source images for appearance transfer. However, it is particularly challenging to obtain satisfactory transfer results. In this paper, we address this issue by rendering a human texture map to a surface geometry (represented as a UV map), which is personalized to the source person. Our geometry generator combines the shape information from source images, and the pose information from 2D keypoints to synthesize the personalized UV map. A texture generator then generates the texture map conditioned on the texture of source images to fill out invisible parts. Furthermore, we may fine-tune the texture map on the manifold of the texture generator from a few source images at the test time, which improves the quality of the texture map without over-fitting or artifacts.

The core insight is that a defocus blur region/focused clear area can be arbitrarily pasted to a given realistic full blurred image/full clear image without affecting the judgment of the full blurred image/full clear image. Specifically, we train a generator G in an adversarial manner against dual discriminators Dc and Db. G learns to produce a DBD mask that generates a composite clear image and a composite blurred image through copying the focused area and unfocused region from corresponding source image to another full clear image and full blurred image. Then, Dc and Db can not distinguish them from realistic full clear image and full blurred image simultaneously, achieving a self-generated DBD by an implicit manner to define what a defocus blur area is. Besides, we propose a bilateral triplet-excavating constraint to avoid the degenerate problem caused by the case one discriminator defeats the other one.

We describe a class of models whose geometric rigidity is easily controlled to manage this tradeoff.

While fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) strives to arrive at the former, for the majority of us non-experts just ""bird"" would probably suffice. The real question is therefore -- how can we tailor for different fine-grained definitions under divergent levels of expertise. For that, we re-envisage the traditional setting of FGVC, from single-label classification, to that of top-down traversal of a pre-defined coarse-to-fine label hierarchy -- so that our answer becomes ""bird""=""Phoenicopteriformes""=""Phoenicopteridae""=""flamingo"". To approach this new problem, we first conduct a comprehensive human study where we confirm that most participants prefer multi-granularity labels, regardless whether they consider themselves experts. We then discover the key intuition that: coarse-level label prediction exacerbates fine-grained feature learning, yet fine-level feature betters the learning of coarse-level classifier. This discovery enables us to design a very simple albeit surprisingly effective solution to our new problem, where we (i) leverage level-specific classification heads to disentangle coarse-level features with fine-grained ones, and (ii) allow finer-grained features to participate in coarser-grained label predictions, which in turn helps with better disentanglement. Experiments show that our method achieves superior performance in the new FGVC setting, and performs better than state-of-the-art on traditional single-label FGVC problem as well. Thanks to its simplicity, our method can be easily implemented on top of any existing FGVC frameworks and is parameter-free.

In contrast, existing techniques for learning to drive preclude such a possibility as they assume direct access to an instrumented ego-vehicle with fully known observations and expert driver actions. However, such measurements cannot be directly accessed for the non-ego vehicles when learning by watching others. Therefore, in an application where data is regarded as a highly valuable asset, current approaches completely discard the vast portion of the training data that can be potentially obtained through indirect observation of surrounding vehicles. Motivated by this key insight, we propose the Learning by Watching (LbW) framework which enables learning a driving policy without requiring full knowledge of neither the state nor expert actions. To increase its data, i.e., with new perspectives and maneuvers, LbW makes use of the demonstrations of other vehicles in a given scene by (1) transforming the ego-vehicle's observations to their points of view, and (2) inferring their expert actions. Our LbW agent learns more robust driving policies while enabling data-efficient learning, including quick adaptation of the policy to rare and novel scenarios.

Recently, both optimization-based and learning-based face reconstruction methods have taken advantage of the emerging differentiable renderer and shown promising results. However, the differentiable renderer, mainly based on graphics rules, simplifies the realistic mechanism of the illumination, reflection, etc., of the real world, thus can-not produce realistic images.

Existing efforts leverage a long training video from each target person to train a subject-specific motion transfer model. However, the scalability of such methods is limited, as each model can only generate videos for the given target subject, and such training videos are labor-intensive to acquire and process. Few-shot motion transfer techniques, which only require one or a few images from a target, have recently drawn considerable attention. Methods addressing this task generally use either 2D or explicit 3D representations to transfer motion, and in doing so, sacrifice either accurate geometric modeling or the flexibility of an end-to-end learned representation. Inspired by the Transformable Bottleneck Network, which renders novel views and manipulations of rigid objects, we propose an approach based on an implicit volumetric representation of the image content, which can then be spatially manipulated using volumetric flow fields. We address the challenging question of how to aggregate information across different body poses, learning flow fields that allow for combining content from the appropriate regions of input images of highly non-rigid human subjects performing complex motions into a single implicit volumetric representation. This allows us to learn our 3D representation solely from videos of moving people.

Almost all the existing DG ReID methods follow the same pipeline where they use a hybrid dataset from multiple source domains for training, and then directly apply the trained model to the unseen target domains for testing. These methods often neglect individual source domains' discriminative characteristics and their relevances w.r.t. the unseen target domains, though both of which can be leveraged to help the model's generalization. To handle the above two issues, we propose a novel method called the relevance-aware mixture of experts (RaMoE), using an effective voting-based mixture mechanism to dynamically leverage source domains' diverse characteristics to improve the model's generalization. Specifically, we propose a decorrelation loss to make the source domain networks (experts) keep the diversity and discriminability of individual domains' characteristics. Besides, we design a voting network to adaptively integrate all the experts' features into the more generalizable aggregated features with domain relevance. Considering the target domains' invisibility during training, we propose a novel learning-to-learn algorithm combined with our relation alignment loss to update the voting network.

The model infers a latent 3D representation of the scene in the form of 3D feature points, where each continuous world 3D point is mapped to its corresponding feature vector. The model is trained for contrastive view prediction by rendering 3D feature clouds in queried viewpoints and matching against the 3D feature point cloud predicted from the query view.

The difficulties lie in many aspects and this work focus on computing resource constraint and long-tailed class distribution. Recently, classification-based representation learning with deep neural networks and well-designed losses have demonstrated good recognition performance. However, the computing and memory cost linearly scales up to the number of identities (classes) in the training set, and the learning process suffers from unbalanced classes. In this work, we propose a dynamic class queue (DCQ) to tackle these two problems. Specifically, for each iteration during training, a subset of classes for recognition are dynamically selected and their class weights are dynamically generated on-the-fly which are stored in a queue. Since only a subset of classes is selected for each iteration, the computing requirement is reduced. By using a single server without model parallel, we empirically verify in large-scale datasets that 10% of classes are sufficient to achieve similar performance as using all classes. Moreover, the class weights are dynamically generated in a few-shot manner and therefore suitable for tail classes with only a few instances. We show clear improvement over a strong baseline in the largest public dataset Megaface Challenge2 (MF2) which has 672K identities and over 88% of them have less than 10 instances.

There exists a significant gap between the architectures in search and evaluation. As a result, current methods suffer from an inconsistent, inefficient, and inflexible search process. In this paper, we introduce EnTranNAS that is composed of Engine-cells and Transit-cells. The Engine-cell is differentiable for architecture search, while the Transit-cell only transits a sub-graph by architecture derivation. Consequently, the gap between the architectures in search and evaluation is significantly reduced. Our method also spares much memory and computation cost, which speeds up the search process. A feature sharing strategy is introduced for more balanced optimization and more efficient search. Furthermore, we develop an architecture derivation method to replace the traditional one that is based on a hand-crafted rule. Our method enables differentiable sparsification, and keeps the derived architecture equivalent to that of Engine-cell, which further improves the consistency between search and evaluation. More importantly, it supports the search for topology where a node can be connected to prior nodes with any number of connections, so that the searched architectures could be more flexible. Our search on CIFAR-10 has an error rate of 2.22% with only 0.07 GPU-day.

Gaussian Context Transformer,"Dongsheng Ruan, Daiyin Wang, Yuan Zheng, Nenggan Zheng, Min Zheng"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 15129-15138","Recently, a large number of channel attention blocks are proposed to boost the representational power of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These approaches commonly learn the relationship between global contexts and attention activations by using fully-connected layers or linear transformations. However, we empirically find that though many parameters are introduced, these attention blocks may not learn the relationship well. In this paper, we hypothesize that the relationship is predetermined. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a simple yet extremely efficient channel attention block, called Gaussian Context Transformer (GCT), which achieves contextual feature excitation using a Gaussian function that satisfies the presupposed relationship. According to whether the standard deviation of the Gaussian function is learnable, we develop two versions of GCT: GCT-B0 and GCT-B1. GCT-B0 is a parameter-free channel attention block by fixing the standard deviation. It directly maps global contexts to attention activations without learning. In contrast, GCT-B1 is a parameterized channel attention block, which adaptively learns the standard deviation to enhance the mapping ability. Extensive experiments on ImageNet and MS COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our GCTs lead to consistent improvements across various deep CNNs and detectors. Compared with a bank of state-of-the-art channel attention blocks, such as SE and ECA , our GCTs are superior in effectiveness and efficiency.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Ruan_Gaussian_Context_Transformer_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Keypoint-Graph-Driven Learning Framework for Object Pose Estimation,"Shaobo Zhang, Wanqing Zhao, Ziyu Guan, Xianlin Peng, Jinye Peng"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 1065-1073","Many recent 6D pose estimation methods exploited object 3D models to generate synthetic images for training because labels come for free. However, due to the domain shift of data distributions between real images and synthetic images, the network trained only on synthetic images fails to capture robust features in real images for 6D pose estimation. We propose to solve this problem by making the network insensitive to different domains, rather than taking the more difficult route of forcing synthetic images to be similar to real images. Inspired by domain adaption methods, a Domain Adaptive Keypoints Detection Network (DAKDN) including a domain adaption layer is used to minimize the discrepancy of deep features between synthetic and real images. A unique challenge here is the lack of ground truth labels (i.e., keypoints) for real images. Fortunately, the geometry relations between keypoints are invariant under real/synthetic domains. Hence, we propose to use the domain-invariant geometry structure among keypoints as a ""bridge"" constraint to optimize DAKDN for 6D pose estimation across domains. Specifically, DAKDN employs a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) block to learn the geometry structure from synthetic images and uses the GCN to guide the training for real images. The 6D poses of objects are calculated using Perspective-n-Point (PnP) algorithm based on the predicted keypoints. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches without manual poses labels and competes with approaches using manual poses labels.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Zhang_Keypoint-Graph-Driven_Learning_Framework_for_Object_Pose_Estimation_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

This key advantage, along with the increasing popularity of burst photography, have made MFSR an important problem for real-world applications. We propose a novel architecture for the burst super-resolution task. Our network takes multiple noisy RAW images as input, and generates a denoised, super-resolved RGB image as output. This is achieved by explicitly aligning deep embeddings of the input frames using pixel-wise optical flow. The information from all frames are then adaptively merged using an attention-based fusion module.

Transferable Semantic Augmentation for Domain Adaptation,"Shuang Li, Mixue Xie, Kaixiong Gong, Chi Harold Liu, Yulin Wang, Wei Li"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 11516-11525","Domain adaptation has been widely explored by transferring the knowledge from a label-rich source domain to a related but unlabeled target domain. Most existing domain adaptation algorithms attend to adapting feature representations across two domains with the guidance of a shared source-supervised classifier. However, such classifier limits the generalization ability towards unlabeled target recognition. To remedy this, we propose a Transferable Semantic Augmentation (TSA) approach to enhance the classifier adaptation ability through implicitly generating source features towards target semantics. Specifically, TSA is inspired by the fact that deep feature transformation towards a certain direction can be represented as meaningful semantic altering in the original input space. Thus, source features can be augmented to effectively equip with target semantics to train a more transferable classifier. To achieve this, for each class, we first use the inter-domain feature mean difference and target intra-class feature covariance to construct a multivariate normal distribution. Then we augment source features with random directions sampled from the distribution class-wisely. Interestingly, such source augmentation is implicitly implemented through an expected transferable cross-entropy loss over the augmented source distribution, where an upper bound of the expected loss is derived and minimized, introducing negligible computational overhead. As a light-weight and general technique, TSA can be easily plugged into various domain adaptation methods, bringing remarkable improvements. Comprehensive experiments on cross-domain benchmarks validate the efficacy of TSA.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Li_Transferable_Semantic_Augmentation_for_Domain_Adaptation_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Meanwhile, a coarse-to-fine sequential training and sampling strategy is presented to train the model efficiently. Besides learning to generate random samples from white noise, the model can learn in parallel to recover a real image from its incomplete version, which can improve the descriptive power of the learned models. The proposed model not only is simple and natural in that it does not require auxiliary models (e.g., discriminators) to assist the training, but also unifies internal statistics learning and image generation in a single framework.

In comparison, the existing iterative methods extract a single object at a time using discriminative knowledge-based properties (e.g., shapes, boundaries, etc.) without relying on post-processing.

To exploit the advantages of conventional sequential segmentation methods without impairing the scalability, we propose a novel iterative deep reinforcement learning agent that learns how to differentiate multiple objects in parallel.

This trade-off could be mitigated if gallery embeddings are generated from a large model and query embeddings are extracted using a compact model. The key to building such a system is to ensure representation compatibility between the query and gallery models.

Previous attempts to linearize DNNs have led to interesting theoretical insights, but have not impacted the practice due to the substantial performance gap compared to standard non-linear optimization. We present the first method for linearizing a pre-trained model that achieves comparable performance to non-linear fine-tuning on most of real-world image classification tasks tested, thus enjoying the interpretability of linear models without incurring punishing losses in performance. LQF consists of simple modifications to the architecture, loss function and optimization typically used for classification: Leaky-ReLU instead of ReLU, mean squared loss instead of cross-entropy, and pre-conditioning using Kronecker factorization.

To address this problem, we present PoseAug, a new auto-augmentation framework that learns to augment the available training poses towards a greater diversity and thus improve generalization of the trained 2D-to-3D pose estimator. Specifically, PoseAug introduces a novel pose augmentor that learns to adjust various geometry factors (e.g., posture, body size, view point and position) of a pose through differentiable operations. With such differentiable capacity, the augmentor can be jointly optimized with the 3D pose estimator and take the estimation error as feedback to generate more diverse and harder poses in an online manner. Moreover, PoseAug introduces a novel part-aware Kinematic Chain Space for evaluating local joint-angle plausibility and develops a discriminative module accordingly to ensure the plausibility of the augmented poses. These elaborate designs enable PoseAug to generate more diverse yet plausible poses than existing offline augmentation methods, and thus yield better generalization of the pose estimator. PoseAug is generic and easy to be applied to various 3D pose estimators. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PoseAug brings clear improvements on both intra-scenario and cross-scenario datasets.

However, they fail to perform as accurately in real-world scenarios, where the category distribution of objects naturally comes with a long tail. Instances of head classes dominate a long-tailed dataset and they serve as negative samples of tail categories. The overwhelming gradients of negative samples on tail classes lead to a biased learning process for classifiers. Consequently, objects of tail categories are more likely to be misclassified as backgrounds or head categories. To tackle this problem, we propose Seesaw Loss to dynamically re-balance gradients of positive and negative samples for each category, with two complementary factors, i.e., mitigation factor and compensation factor.

The selection network is optimized with policy gradient methods to maximize a reward that encourages making correct predictions with limited computation. We conduct experiments on three video recognition benchmarks and demonstrate that our method achieves similar accuracies to state-of-the-art 3D models while requiring 20%-50% less computation across different datasets. We also show that learned policies are transferable and Ada3D is compatible to different backbones and modern clip selection approaches.

However, such activation maps usually highlight the local discriminative regions rather than the whole object, which deviates from the requirement of semantic segmentation. To explore more comprehensive class-specific activation maps, we propose an Embedded Discriminative Attention Mechanism (EDAM) by integrating the activation map generation into the classification network directly for WSSS. Specifically, a Discriminative Activation (DA) layer is designed to explicitly produce a series of normalized class-specific masks, which are then used to generate class-specific pixel-level pseudo-labels demanded in segmentation. For learning the pseudo-labels, the masks are multiplied with the feature maps after the backbone to generate the discriminative activation maps, each of which encodes the specific information of the corresponding category in the input images. Given such class-specific activation maps, a Collaborative Multi-Attention (CMA) module is proposed to extract the collaborative information of each given category from images in a batch. In inference, we directly use the activation masks from the DA layer as pseudo-labels for segmentation. Based on the generated pseudo-labels, we achieve the mIoU of 70:60% on PASCAL VOC 2012 segmentation test set, which is the new state-of-the-art, to our best knowledge.

We find that accurate knowledge of neural architecture is significantly more important than knowledge of the training data in black-box attacks. Moreover, we observe that open-set face recognition systems are more vulnerable than closed-set systems under different types of attacks. The efficacy of attacks for other threat model variations, however, appears highly dependent on both the nature of perturbation and the neural network architecture. For example, attacks that involve adversarial face masks are usually more potent, even against adversarially trained models, and the ArcFace architecture tends to be more robust than the others.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Tong_FaceSec_A_Fine-Grained_Robustness_Evaluation_Framework_for_Face_Recognition_Systems_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Existing image captioning methods commonly target at generic images, and lack mechanism to meet this requirement. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose a self-boosting framework that improves radiographic report generation based on the cooperation of the main task of report generation and anauxiliary task of image-text matching. The two tasks are built as the two branches of a network model and influence each other in a cooperative way. On one hand, the image-text matching branch helps to learn highly text-correlated visual features for the report generation branch to output high quality reports. One the other hand, the improved reports produced by the report generation branch provideadditional harder samples for the image-text matching task and enforce the latter to improve itself by learning better visual and text feature representations. This, in turn, helps improve the report generation branch again. These two branches are jointly trained to help improve each other iteratively and progressively, so that the whole model is self-boosted without requiring any external resources. Additionally, in the loss function, our model evaluates the quality of the generated reports not only on the word similarity as common approaches do (via minimizing a cross-entropy loss), but also on the feature similarity at high-level, while the latter is provided by the text-encoder of the image-text matching branch.

By maintaining the minimum hyperspherical energy during training, OPT can greatly improve the empirical generalization. Specifically, OPT fixes the randomly initialized weights of the neurons and learns an orthogonal transformation that applies to these neurons. We consider multiple ways to learn such an orthogonal transformation, including unrolling orthogonalization algorithms, applying orthogonal parameterization, and designing orthogonality-preserving gradient descent. For better scalability, we propose the stochastic OPT which performs orthogonal transformation stochastically for partial dimensions of neurons.

Deep Ensembles are widely considered as being one of the best methods for generating uncertainty estimates but are very expensive to train and evaluate. MC-Dropout is another popular alternative, which is less expensive, but also less reliable. Our central intuition is that there is a continuous spectrum of ensemble-like models of which MC-Dropout and Deep Ensembles are extreme examples. The first uses effectively infinite number of highly correlated models while the second relies on a finite number of independent models. To combine the benefits of both, we introduce Masksembles. Instead of randomly dropping parts of the network as in MC-dropout, Masksemble relies on a fixed number of binary masks, which are parameterized in a way that allows to change correlations between individual models. Namely, by controlling the overlap between the masks and their density one can choose the optimal configuration for the task at hand.

Recent studies have shown that many samples contain multiple classes, despite being assumed to be a single-label benchmark. They have thus proposed to turn ImageNet evaluation into a multi-label task, with exhaustive multi-label annotations per image. However, they have not fixed the training set, presumably because of a formidable annotation cost. We argue that the mismatch between single-label annotations and effectively multi-label images is equally, if not more, problematic in the training setup, where random crops are applied. With the single-label annotations, a random crop of an image may contain an entirely different object from the ground truth, introducing noisy or even incorrect supervision during training. We thus re-label the ImageNet training set with multi-labels. We address the annotation cost barrier by letting a strong image classifier, trained on an extra source of data, generate the multi-labels. We utilize the pixel-wise multi-label predictions before the final pooling layer, in order to exploit the additional location-specific supervision signals. Training on the re-labeled samples results in improved model performances across the board.

Unfortunately, the GPU memory is physically finite, which limits the image resolutions and batch sizes that could be used in training for better DNN performance. Unlike solutions that require physically upgrade GPUs, the Gradient CheckPointing(GCP) training trades computation for more memory beyond existing GPU hardware. GCP only stores a subset of intermediate tensors, called Gradient Checkpoints (GCs), during forward. Then during backward, extra local forwards are conducted to compute the missing tensors. The total training memory cost becomes the sum of (1) the memory cost of the gradient checkpoints and (2) the maximum memory cost of local forwards. To achieve maximal memory cut-offs, one needs optimal algorithms to select GCs. Existing GCP approaches rely on either manual input of GCs or heuristics-based GC search on Linear Computation Graphs (LCGs), and cannot apply to Arbitrary Computation Graphs(ACGs). In this paper, we present theories and optimal algorithms on GC selection that, for the first time, are applicable to ACGs and achieve the maximal memory cut-offs.

Different from existing public datasets, iMiGUE focuses on nonverbal body gestures without using any identity information, while the predominant researches of emotion analysis concern sensitive biometric data, like face and speech. Most importantly, iMiGUE focuses on micro-gestures, i,e., unintentional behaviors driven by inner feelings, which are different from ordinary scope of gestures from other gesture datasets which are mostly intentionally performed for illustrative purposes. Furthermore, iMiGUE is designed to evaluate the ability of models to analyze the emotional states by integrating information of recognized micro-gesture, rather than just recognizing prototypes in the sequences separately (or isolatedly). This is because the real need for emotion AI is to understand the emotional states behind gestures in a holistic way. Moreover, to counter for the challenge of imbalanced samples distribution of this dataset, an unsupervised learning method is proposed to capture latent representations from the micro-gesture sequences themselves. We systematically investigate representative methods on this dataset, and comprehensive experimental results reveal several interesting insights from the iMiGUE, e,g., micro-gesture-based analysis can promote emotion understanding.

In this work we present a denoising approach for extremely low-light images of permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) on the lunar surface, taken by the Narrow Angle Camera on board the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter satellite.

Visual localization algorithms are a fundamental building block in advanced computer vision applications, including Mixed and Virtual Reality systems. Many algorithms used in practice represent the scene through a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point cloud, where each 3D point is associated with one or more local image features. Establishing 2D-3D matches between features in a query image and the 3D points through descriptor matching Visual localization is the problem of estimating the camera pose of a given image with respect to a known scene. Visual localization algorithms are a fundamental building block in advanced computer vision applications, including Mixed and Virtual Reality systems. Many algorithms used in practice represent the scene through a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) point cloud and use 2D-3D matches between a query image and the 3D points for camera pose estimation. As recently shown, image details can be accurately recovered from SfM point clouds by translating renderings of the sparse point clouds to images. To address the resulting potential privacy risks for user-generated content, it was recently proposed to lift point clouds to line clouds by replacing 3D points by randomly oriented 3D lines passing through these points. The resulting representation is unintelligible to humans and effectively prevents point cloud-to-image translation. This paper shows that a significant amount of information about the 3D scene geometry is preserved in these line clouds, allowing us to (approximately) recover the 3D point positions and thus to (approximately) recover image content. Our approach is based on the observation that the closest points between lines can yield a good approximation to the original 3D points.

Unlike existing solutions, we do not explicitly solve for correspondence. Instead, we argue the problem is generally well-posed by multi-view geometrical and photometric constraints, and can be solved from a small number of input views. We formulate the reconstruction task as a joint energy minimization over the surface geometry and reflectance.

In this work, we propose a novel approach to address the task incremental learning problem, which involves training a model on new tasks that arrive in an incremental manner. The task incremental learning problem becomes even more challenging when the test set contains classes that are not part of the train set, i.e., a task incremental generalized zero-shot learning problem. Our approach can be used in both the zero-shot and non zero-shot task incremental learning settings. Our proposed method uses weight rectifications and affine transformations in order to adapt the model to different tasks that arrive sequentially. Specifically, we adapt the network weights to work for new tasks by ""rectifying"" the weights learned from the previous task. We learn these weight rectifications using very few parameters. We additionally learn affine transformations on the outputs generated by the network in order to better adapt them for the new task. We perform experiments on several datasets in both zero-shot and non zero-shot task incremental learning settings and empirically show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results. Specifically, our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art non zero-shot task incremental learning method by over 5% on the CIFAR-100 dataset.

It was believed that the success lies in the high-level perceptual feature representations extracted from CNNs pretrained with a large set of images. Here we reveal that what matters is the network structure instead of the trained weights. Without any learning, the structure of a deep network is sufficient to capture the dependencies between multiple levels of variable statistics using multiple layers of CNNs. This insight removes the requirements of pre-training and a particular network structure (commonly, VGG) that are previously assumed for the perceptual loss, thus enabling a significantly wider range of applications. To this end, we demonstrate that a randomly-weighted deep CNN can be used to model the structured dependencies of outputs. On a few dense per-pixel prediction tasks such as semantic segmentation, depth estimation, and instance segmentation, we show improved results of using the extended randomized perceptual loss, compared to the baselines using pixel-wise loss alone.

We first statistically model the network pruning problem in a redundancy reduction perspective and find that pruning in the layer(s) with the most structural redundancy outperforms pruning the least important filters across all layers. Based on this finding, we then propose a network pruning approach that identifies structural redundancy of a CNN and prunes filers in the selected layer(s) with the most redundancy.

Regularizing CNNs works well on learning with such deteriorated training datasets by mitigating overfitting issues. In this work, we propose a method to effectively impose regularization on feature representation learning. By focusing on the angle between a feature and a classifier which is embedded in cosine similarity at the classification layer, we formulate a novel similarity beyond the cosine based on von Mises-Fisher distribution of directional statistics. In contrast to the cosine similarity, our similarity is compact while having heavy tail, which contributes to regularizing intra-class feature distribution to improve generalization performance.

Addressing this problem, we propose a learnable module that learns Spatial Contextual Features from large-scale point clouds, called SCF in this paper. The proposed module mainly consists of three blocks, including the local polar representation block, the dual-distance attentive pooling block, and the global contextual feature block. For each 3D point, the local polar representation block is firstly explored to construct a spatial representation that is invariant to the z-axis rotation, then the dual-distance attentive pooling block is designed to utilize the representations of its neighbors for learning more discriminative local features according to both the geometric and feature distances among them, and finally, the global contextual feature block is designed to learn a global context for each 3D point by utilizing its spatial location and the volume ratio of the neighborhood to the global point cloud. The proposed module could be easily embedded into various network architectures for point cloud segmentation, naturally resulting in a new 3D semantic segmentation network with an encoder-decoder architecture, called SCF-Net in this work.

This suggests that there is a domain gap between current datasets and common scenes containing people. To obtain ground-truth 3D pose, current datasets limit the complexity of clothing, environmental conditions, number of subjects, and occlusion. Moreover, current datasets evaluate sparse 3D joint locations corresponding to the major joints of the body, ignoring the hand pose and the face shape. To evaluate the current state-of-the-art methods on more challenging images, and to drive the field to address new problems, we introduce AGORA, a synthetic dataset with high realism and highly accurate ground truth. Here we use 4240 commercially-available, high-quality, textured human scans in diverse poses and natural clothing; this includes 257 scans of children. We create reference 3D poses and body shapes by fitting the SMPL-X body model (with face and hands) to the 3D scans, taking into account clothing. We create around 14K training and 3K test images by rendering between 5 and 15 people per image using either image-based lighting or rendered 3D environments, taking care to make the images physically plausible and photoreal. In total, AGORA consists of 173K individual person crops. We evaluate existing state-of-the-art methods for 3D human pose estimation on this dataset and find that most methods perform poorly on images of children. Hence, we extend the SMPL-X model to better capture the shape of children. Additionally, we fine-tune methods on AGORA and show improved performance on both AGORA and 3DPW, confirming the realism of the dataset.

This obviates the need to store a large dense semidefinite matrix.

In this work, we introduce a general method for 3D self-supervised representation learning that 1) remains agnostic to the underlying neural network architecture, and 2) specifically leverages the geometric nature of 3D point cloud data. The proposed task softly segments 3D points into a discrete number of geometric partitions. A self-supervised loss is formed under the interpretation that these soft partitions implicitly parameterize a latent Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), and that this generative model establishes a data likelihood function. Our pretext task can therefore be viewed in terms of an encoder-decoder paradigm that squeezes learned representations through an implicitly defined parametric discrete generative model bottleneck. We show that any existing neural network architecture designed for supervised point cloud segmentation can be repurposed for the proposed unsupervised pretext task. By maximizing data likelihood with respect to the soft partitions formed by the unsupervised point-wise segmentation network, learned representations are encouraged to contain compositionally rich geometric information.

Black, Siyu Tang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 3372-3382","A key step towards understanding human behavior is the prediction of 3D human motion. Successful solutions have many applications in human tracking, HCI, and graphics. Most previous work focuses on predicting a time series of future 3D joint locations given a sequence 3D joints from the past. This Euclidean formulation generally works better than predicting pose in terms of joint rotations. Body joint locations, however, do not fully constrain 3D human pose, leaving degrees of freedom (like rotation about a limb) undefined. Note that 3D joints can be viewed as a sparse point cloud. Thus the problem of human motion prediction can be seen as a problem of point cloud prediction. With this observation, we instead predict a sparse set of locations on the body surface that correspond to motion capture markers. Given such markers, we fit a parametric body model to recover the 3D body of the person. These sparse surface markers also carry detailed information about human movement that is not present in the joints, increasing the naturalness of the predicted motions. Using the AMASS dataset, we train MOJO (More than Our JOints), which is a novel variational autoencoder with a latent DCT space that generates motions from latent frequencies. MOJO preserves the full temporal resolution of the input motion, and sampling from the latent frequencies explicitly introduces high-frequency components into the generated motion. We note that motion prediction methods accumulate errors over time, resulting in joints or markers that diverge from true human bodies. To address this, we fit the SMPL-X body model to the predictions at each time step, projecting the solution back onto the space of valid bodies, before propagating the new markers in time. Quantitative and qualitative experiments show that our approach produces state-of-the-art results and realistic 3D body animations.

We design the generator to be an extremely lightweight function of the full-resolution image. In fact, we use pixel-wise networks; that is, each pixel is processed independently of others, through a composition of simple affine transformations and nonlinearities. We take three important steps to equip such a seemingly simple function with adequate expressivity. First, the parameters of the pixel-wise networks are spatially varying so they can represent a broader function class than simple 1x1 convolutions. Second, these parameters are predicted by a fast convolutional network that processes an aggressively low-resolution representation of the input. Third, we augment the input image with a sinusoidal encoding of spatial coordinates, which provides an effective inductive bias for generating realistic novel high-frequency image content. As a result, our model is up to 18x faster than state-of-the-art baselines.

There are two critical issues: The one is an extremely foreground-background imbalanced distribution and the other is multiple small objects along with complex background. Such problems make the recent dense affinity context modeling perform poorly even compared with baselines due to over-introduced background context. To handle these problems, we propose a point-wise affinity propagation module based on the FPN framework, named PointFlow. Rather than dense affinity learning, a sparse affinity map is generated upon selected points between the adjacent features, which reduces the noise introduced by the background while keeping efficiency. In particular, we design a dual point matcher to select points from the salient area and object boundaries, respectively. The former samples salient points while the latter samples points from the object boundaries. Experimental results on three different aerial segmentation datasets suggest that the proposed method is more effective and efficient than state-of-the-art general semantic segmentation methods. Especially, our methods achieve the best speed and accuracy trade-off on three aerial benchmarks.

In this paper, we consider a more challenging case where neither of the above assumptions holds. We propose to address this problem by removing the dependencies between features via learning weights for training samples, which helps deep models get rid of spurious correlations and, in turn, concentrate more on the true connection between discriminative features and labels.

From this viewpoint, we then propose a novel continual learning approach called Bit-Level Information Preserving (BLIP) that preserves the information gain on model parameters through updating the parameters at the bit level, which can be conveniently implemented with parameter quantization. More specifically, BLIP first trains a neural network with weight quantization on the new incoming task and then estimates information gain on each parameter provided by the task data to determine the bits to be frozen to prevent forgetting. We conduct extensive experiments ranging from classification tasks to reinforcement learning tasks, and the results show that our method produces better or on par results comparing to previous state-of-the-arts.

We address and exploit this dual representation by proposing two novel cross-modal translation pre-text tasks for self-supervised feature learning: Vectorization and Rasterization.

Generating Diverse Structure for Image Inpainting With Hierarchical VQ-VAE,"Jialun Peng, Dong Liu, Songcen Xu, Houqiang Li"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 10775-10784","Given an incomplete image without additional constraint, image inpainting natively allows for multiple solutions as long as they appear plausible. Recently, multiple-solution inpainting methods have been proposed and shown the potential of generating diverse results. However, these methods have difficulty in ensuring the quality of each solution, e.g. they produce distorted structure and/or blurry texture. We propose a two-stage model for diverse inpainting, where the first stage generates multiple coarse results each of which has a different structure, and the second stage refines each coarse result separately by augmenting texture. The proposed model is inspired by the hierarchical vector quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE), whose hierarchical architecture disentangles structural and textural information. In addition, the vector quantization in VQ-VAE enables autoregressive modeling of the discrete distribution over the structural information. Sampling from the distribution can easily generate diverse and high-quality structures, making up the first stage of our model. In the second stage, we propose a structural attention module inside the texture generation network, where the module utilizes the structural information to capture distant correlations. We further reuse the VQ-VAE to calculate two feature losses, which help improve structure coherence and texture realism, respectively. Experimental results on CelebA-HQ, Places2, and ImageNet datasets show that our method not only enhances the diversity of the inpainting solutions but also improves the visual quality of the generated multiple images.

To reduce the necessity of training a large teacher model, the recent literatures introduced a self-knowledge distillation, which trains a student network progressively to distill its own knowledge without a pretrained teacher network. While Self-knowledge distillation is largely divided into a data augmentation based approach and an auxiliary network based approach, the data augmentation approach looses its local information in the augmentation process, which hinders its applicability to diverse vision tasks, such as semantic segmentation. Moreover, these knowledge distillation approaches do not receive the refined feature maps, which are prevalent in the object detection and semantic segmentation community. This paper proposes a novel self-knowledge distillation method, Feature Refinement via Self-Knowledge Distillation (FRSKD), which utilizes an auxiliary self-teacher network to transfer a refined knowledge for the classifier network. Our proposed method, FRSKD, can utilize both soft label and feature-map distillations for the self-knowledge distillation. Therefore, FRSKD can be applied to classification, and semantic segmentation, which emphasize preserving the local information.

Self-Supervised Visibility Learning for Novel View Synthesis,"Yujiao Shi, Hongdong Li, Xin Yu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 9675-9684","We address the problem of novel view synthesis (NVS) from a few sparse source view images. Conventional image-based rendering methods estimate scene geometry and synthesize novel views in two separate steps. However, erroneous geometry estimation will decrease NVS performance as view synthesis highly depends on the quality of estimated scene geometry. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end NVS framework to eliminate the error propagation issue. To be specific, we construct a volume under the target view and design a source-view visibility estimation (SVE) module to determine the visibility of the target-view voxels in each source view. Next, we aggregate the visibility of all source views to achieve a consensus volume. Each voxel in the consensus volume indicates a surface existence probability. Then, we present a soft ray-casting (SRC) mechanism to find the most front surface in the target view (i.e. depth). Specifically, our SRC traverses the consensus volume along viewing rays and then estimates a depth probability distribution. We then warp and aggregate source view pixels to synthesize a novel view based on the estimated source-view visibility and target-view depth. At last, our network is trained in an end-to-end self-supervised fashion, thus significantly alleviating error accumulation in view synthesis.

Compared to existing techniques that regress pose and shape parameters, METRO does not rely on any parametric mesh models like SMPL, thus it can be easily extended to other objects such as hands. We further relax the mesh topology and allow the transformer self-attention mechanism to freely attend between any two vertices, making it possible to learn non-local relationships among mesh vertices and joints. With the proposed masked vertex modeling, our method is more robust and effective in handling challenging situations like partial occlusions. METRO generates new state-of-the-art results for human mesh reconstruction on the public Human3.6M and 3DPW datasets.

CapsuleRRT: Relationships-Aware Regression Tracking via Capsules,"Ding Ma, Xiangqian Wu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 10948-10957","Regression tracking has gained more and more attention thanks to its easy-to-implement characteristics, while existing regression trackers rarely consider the relationships between the object parts and the complete object. This would ultimately result in drift from the target object when missing some parts of the target object. Recently, Capsule Network (CapsNet) has shown promising results for image classification benefits from its part-object relationships mechanism, while CapsNet is known for its high computational demand even when carrying out simple tasks. Therefore, a primitive adaptation of CapsNet to regression tracking does not make sense, since this will seriously affect speed of a tracker. To solve these problems, we first explore the spatial-temporal relationships endowed by the CapsNet for regression tracking. The entire regression framework, dubbed CapsuleRRT, consists of three parts. One is S-Caps, which captures the spatial relationships between the parts and the object. Meanwhile, a T-Caps module is designed to exploit the temporal relationships within the target. The response of the target is obtained by STCaps Learning. Further, a prior-guided capsule routing algorithm is proposed to generate more accurate capsule assignments for subsequent frames. Apart from this, the heavy computation burden in CapsNet is addressed with a knowledge distillation pose matrix compression strategy that exploits more tight and discriminative representation with few samples.

We train the Anycost GAN to support elastic resolutions and channels for faster image generation at versatile speeds. Running subsets of the full generator produce outputs that are perceptually similar to the full generator, making them a good proxy for a quick preview. By using sampling-based multi-resolution training, adaptive-channel training, and a generator-conditioned discriminator, the anycost generator can be evaluated at various configurations while achieving better image quality compared to separately trained models. Furthermore, we develop new encoder training and latent code optimization techniques to encourage consistency between the different sub-generators during image projection. Anycost GAN can be executed at various cost budgets (up to 10x computation reduction) and adapt to a wide range of hardware and latency requirements.

Assuming that the model structures of deep trackers are known, a variety of white-box attack approaches to visual tracking have demonstrated promising results. However, the model knowledge about deep trackers is usually unavailable in real applications. In this paper, we propose a decision-based black-box attack method for visual object tracking. In contrast to existing black-box adversarial attack methods that deal with static images for image classification, we propose IoU attack that sequentially generates perturbations based on the predicted IoU scores from both current and historical frames. By decreasing the IoU scores, the proposed attack method degrades the accuracy of temporal coherent bounding boxes (i.e., object motions) accordingly. In addition, we transfer the learned perturbations to the next few frames to initialize temporal motion attacks. We validate the proposed IoU attack on state-of-the-art deep trackers (i.e., detection based, correlation filter based, and long-term trackers). Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets indicate the effectiveness of the proposed IoU attack method.

Deep Graph Matching Under Quadratic Constraint,"Quankai Gao, Fudong Wang, Nan Xue, Jin-Gang Yu, Gui-Song Xia"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 5069-5078","Recently, deep learning based methods have demonstrated promising results on the graph matching problem, by relying on the descriptive capability of deep features extracted on graph nodes. However, one main limitation with existing deep graph matching (DGM) methods lies in their ignorance of explicit constraint of graph structures, which may lead the model to be trapped into local minimum in training. In this paper, we propose to explicitly formulate pairwise graph structures as a quadratic constraint incorporated into the DGM framework. The quadratic constraint minimizes the pairwise structural discrepancy between graphs, which can reduce the ambiguities brought by only using the extracted CNN features. Moreover, we present a differentiable implementation to the quadratic constrained-optimization such that it is compatible with the unconstrained deep learning optimizer. To give more precise and proper supervision, a well-designed false matching loss against class imbalance is proposed, which can better penalize the false negatives and false positives with less overfitting.

We address this challenge by leveraging a new data resource: a number of social media dance videos that span diverse appearance, clothing styles, performances, and identities. Each video depicts dynamic movements of the body and clothes of a single person while lacking the 3D ground truth geometry. To utilize these videos, we present a new method to use the local transformation that warps the predicted local geometry of the person from an image to that of the other image at a different time instant. With the transformation, the predicted geometry can be self-supervised by the warped geometry from the other image. In addition, we jointly learn the depth along with the surface normals, which are highly responsive to local texture, wrinkle, and shade by maximizing their geometric consistency. Our method is end-to-end trainable, resulting in high fidelity depth estimation that predicts fine geometry faithful to the input real image.

Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation via Latent Energy Transport,"Yang Zhao, Changyou Chen"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 16418-16427","Image-to-image translation aims to preserve source contents while translating to discriminative target styles between two visual domains. Most works apply adversarial learning in the ambient image space, which could be computationally expensive and challenging to train. In this paper, we propose to deploy an energy-based model (EBM) in the latent space of a pretrained autoencoder for this task. The pretrained autoencoder serves as both a latent code extractor and an image reconstruction worker. Our model, LETIT, is based on the assumption that two domains share the same latent space, where latent representation is implicitly decomposed as a content code and a domain-specific style code. Instead of explicitly extracting the two codes and applying adaptive instance normalization to combine them, our latent EBM can implicitly learn to transport the source style code to the target style code while preserving the content code, an advantage over existing image translation methods. This simplified solution is also more efficient in the one-sided unpaired image translation setting. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons demonstrate superior translation quality and faithfulness for content preservation. Our model is the first to be applicable to 1024x1024-resolution unpaired image translation to the best of our knowledge.

Directly applying generic compression approaches yields poor results on GANs, which motivates a number of recent GAN compression works. While prior works mainly accelerate conditional GANs, e.g., pix2pix and CycleGAN, compressing state-of-the-art unconditional GANs has rarely been explored and is more challenging. In this paper, we propose novel approaches for unconditional GAN compression. We first introduce effective channel pruning and knowledge distillation schemes specialized for unconditional GANs. We then propose a novel content-aware method to guide the processes of both pruning and distillation. With content-awareness, we can effectively prune channels that are unimportant to the contents of interest, e.g., human faces, and focus our distillation on these regions, which significantly enhances the distillation quality. On StyleGAN2 and SN-GAN, we achieve a substantial improvement over the state-of-the-art compression method. Notably, we reduce the FLOPs of StyleGAN2 by 11x with visually negligible image quality loss compared to the full-size model.

Particularly, when only ""single"" noisy images are available for training a denoiser, the denoising performance of existing methods was not satisfactory. Recently, the blind pixelwise affine image denoiser (BP-AIDE) was proposed and significantly improved the performance in the above setting, to the extent that it is competitive with denoisers which utilized additional information. However, BP-AIDE seriously suffered from slow inference time due to the inefficiency of noise level estimation procedure and that of the blind-spot network (BSN) architecture it used. To that end, we propose Fast Blind Image Denoiser (FBI-Denoiser) for Poisson-Gaussian noise, which consists of two neural network models; 1) PGE-Net that estimates Poisson-Gaussian noise parameters 2000 times faster than the conventional methods and 2) FBI-Net that realizes a much more efficient BSN for pixelwise affine denoiser in terms of the number of parameters and inference speed.

Recently, an unsupervised learning approach has garnered considerable attention owing to its advantages in data collection. However, to mitigate training limitations, typical methods need to impose assumptions for viewpoint distribution (e.g., a dataset containing various viewpoint images) or object shape (e.g., symmetric objects). These assumptions often restrict applications; for instance, the application to non-rigid objects or images captured from similar viewpoints (e.g., flower or bird images) remains a challenge. To complement these approaches, we propose aperture rendering generative adversarial networks (AR-GANs), which equip aperture rendering on top of GANs, and adopt focus cues to learn the depth and depth-of-field (DoF) effect of unlabeled natural images. To address the ambiguities triggered by unsupervised setting (i.e., ambiguities between smooth texture and out-of-focus blurs, and between foreground and background blurs), we develop DoF mixture learning, which enables the generator to learn real image distribution while generating diverse DoF images. In addition, we devise a center focus prior to guiding the learning direction.

Motivated from a universal phenomenon that self-similar shape patterns of local surface patches repeat across the entire surface of an object, we aim to push forward the data-driven strategies and propose to learn a local implicit surface network for a shared, adaptive modeling of the entire surface for a direct surface reconstruction from raw point cloud; we also enhance the leveraging of surface self-similarities by improving correlations among the optimized latent codes of individual surface patches.

We are hereby curious and ask: after pre-training, does a pre-trained model indeed have to stay large for its downstream transferability? In this paper, we examine supervised and self-supervised pre-trained models through the lens of the lottery ticket hypothesis (LTH). LTH identifies highly sparse matching subnetworks that can be trained in isolation from (nearly) scratch yet still reach the full models' performance. We extend the scope of LTH and question whether matching subnetworks still exist in pre-trained computer vision models, that enjoy the same downstream transfer performance. Our extensive experiments convey an overall positive message: from all pre-trained weights obtained by ImageNet classification, simCLR, and MoCo, we are consistently able to locate such matching subnetworks at 59.04% to 96.48% sparsity that transfer universally to multiple downstream tasks, whose performance see no degradation compared to using full pre-trained weights. Further analyses reveal that subnetworks found from different pre-training tend to yield diverse mask structures and perturbation sensitivities.

In the black-box setting, current model stealing attacks train a substitute model to counterfeit the functionality of the target model. However, the training requires querying the target model. Consequently, the query complexity remains high, and such attacks can be defended easily. This study aims to train a generalized substitute model called ""Simulator"", which can mimic the functionality of any unknown target model. To this end, we build the training data with the form of multiple tasks by collecting query sequences generated during the attacks of various existing networks. The learning process uses a mean square error-based knowledge-distillation loss in the meta-learning to minimize the difference between the Simulator and the sampled networks. The meta-gradients of this loss are then computed and accumulated from multiple tasks to update the Simulator and subsequently improve generalization. When attacking a target model that is unseen in training, the trained Simulator can accurately simulate its functionality using its limited feedback. As a result, a large fraction of queries can be transferred to the Simulator, thereby reducing query complexity. Results of the comprehensive experiments conducted using the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces query complexity by several orders of magnitude compared to the baseline method.

Several works estimate depth/inverse depth by treating the DP pair as a stereo pair. However, dual-pixel disparity only occurs in image regions with the defocus blur. The heavy defocus blur in DP pairs affects the performance of matching-based depth estimation approaches. Instead of removing the blur effect blindly, we study the formation of the DP pair which links the blur and the depth information. In this paper, we propose a mathematical DP model which can benefit depth estimation by the blur. These explorations motivate us to propose an end-to-end DDDNet (DP-based Depth and Deblur Network) to jointly estimate the depth and restore the image. Moreover, we define a reblur loss, which reflects the relationship of the DP image formation process with depth information, to regularise our depth estimate in training. To meet the requirement of a large amount of data for learning, we propose the first DP image simulator which allows us to create datasets with DP pairs from any existing RGBD dataset. As a side contribution, we collect a real dataset for further research.

While IG has many desirable properties, the method often produces spurious/noisy pixel attributions in regions that are not related to the predicted class when applied to visual models. While this has been previously noted, most existing solutions are aimed at addressing the symptoms by explicitly reducing the noise in the resulting attributions. In this work, we show that one of the causes of the problem is the accumulation of noise along the IG path. To minimize the effect of this source of noise, we propose adapting the attribution path itself -- conditioning the path not just on the image but also on the model being explained. We introduce Adaptive Path Methods (APMs) as a generalization of path methods, and Guided IG as a specific instance of an APM. Empirically, Guided IG creates saliency maps better aligned with the model's prediction and the input image that is being explained.

Spatiotemporal Registration for Event-Based Visual Odometry,"Daqi Liu, Alvaro Parra, Tat-Jun Chin"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 4937-4946","A useful application of event sensing is visual odometry, especially in settings that require high-temporal resolution. The state-of-the-art method of contrast maximisation recovers the motion from a batch of events by maximising the contrast of the image of warped events. However, the cost scales with image resolution and the temporal resolution can be limited by the need for large batch sizes to yield sufficient structure in the contrast image (see supplementary material for demonstration program). In this work, we propose spatiotemporal registration as a compelling technique for event-based rotational motion estimation. We theoretically justify the approach and establish its fundamental and practical advantages over contrast maximisation. In particular, spatiotemporal registration also produces feature tracks as a by-product, which directly supports an efficient visual odometry pipeline with graph-based optimisation for motion averaging. The simplicity of our visual odometry pipeline allows it to process more than 1 M events/second.

However, annotating videos with frame-wise labels to train such models is very expensive and time consuming. While weakly supervised methods trained using only ordered action lists require less annotation effort, the performance is still worse than fully supervised approaches. In this paper, we propose to use timestamp supervision for the temporal action segmentation task. Timestamps require a comparable annotation effort to weakly supervised approaches, and yet provide a more supervisory signal. To demonstrate the effectiveness of timestamp supervision, we propose an approach to train a segmentation model using only timestamps annotations. Our approach uses the model output and the annotated timestamps to generate frame-wise labels by detecting the action changes. We further introduce a confidence loss that forces the predicted probabilities to monotonically decrease as the distance to the timestamps increases.

However, offline interaction between these two steps may allow noisy pseudo labels to substantially hinder the capability of the model. In this paper, we propose a Group-aware Label Transfer (GLT) algorithm, which enables the online interaction and mutual promotion of pseudo-label prediction and representation learning. Specifically, a label transfer algorithm simultaneously uses pseudo labels to train the data while refining the pseudo labels as an online clustering algorithm. It treats the online label refinery problem as an optimal transport problem, which explores the minimum cost for assigning M samples to N pseudo labels. More importantly, we introduce a group-aware strategy to assign implicit attribute group IDs to samples. The combination of the online label refining algorithm and the group-aware strategy can better correct the noisy pseudo label in an online fashion and narrow down the search space of the target identity.

Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown promising ability for MR image super-resolution (SR) given low-resolution (LR) MR images. The LR MR images usually share some visual characteristics: repeating patterns, relatively simpler structures, and less informative background. Most previous CNN-based SR methods treat the spatial pixels (including the background) equally. They also fail to sense the entire space of the input, which is critical for high-quality MR image SR. To address those problems, we propose squeeze and excitation reasoning attention networks (SERAN) for accurate MR image SR. We propose to squeeze attention from global spatial information of the input and obtain global descriptors. Such global descriptors enhance the network's ability to focus on more informative regions and structures in MR images. We further build relationship among those global descriptors and propose primitive relationship reasoning attention. The global descriptors are further refined with the learned attention. To fully make use of the aggregated information, we adaptively recalibrate feature responses with learned adaptive attention vectors. These attention vectors select a subset of global descriptors to complement each spatial location for accurate details and texture reconstruction. We propose squeeze and excitation attention with residual scaling, which not only stabilizes the training but also makes it flexible to other basic networks.

Existing datasets take one of two approaches. Large-scale video datasets contain many action labels but do not contain ground-truth 3D human motion. Alternatively, motion-capture (mocap) datasets have precise body motions but are limited to a small number of actions. To address this, we present BABEL, a large dataset with language labels describing the actions being performed in mocap sequences. BABEL consists of language labels for over 43 hours of mocap sequences from AMASS, containing over 250 unique actions. Each action label in BABEL is precisely aligned with the duration of the corresponding action in the mocap sequence. BABEL also allows overlap of multiple actions, that may each span different durations. This results in a total of over 66000 action segments. The dense annotations can be leveraged for tasks like action recognition, temporal localization, motion synthesis, etc. To demonstrate the value of BABEL as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of models on 3D action recognition. We demonstrate that BABEL poses interesting learning challenges that are applicable to real-world scenarios, and can serve as a useful benchmark for progress in 3D action recognition.

Thanks to the powerful generative facial prior and delicate designs, our GFP-GAN could jointly restore facial details and enhance colors with just a single forward pass, while GAN inversion methods require image-specific optimization at inference.

Effective Sparsification of Neural Networks With Global Sparsity Constraint,"Xiao Zhou, Weizhong Zhang, Hang Xu, Tong Zhang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 3599-3608","Weight pruning is an effective technique to reduce the model size and inference time for deep neural networks in real world deployments. However, since magnitudes and relative importance of weights are very different for different layers of a neural network, existing methods rely on either manual tuning or handcrafted heuristic rules to find appropriate pruning rates individually for each layer. This approach general leads to suboptimal performance. In this paper, by directly working on the probability space, we propose an effective network sparsification method called probabilistic masking (ProbMask), which solves a natural sparsification formulation under global sparsity constraint. The key idea is to use probability as a global criterion for all layers to measure the weight importance. An appealing feature of ProbMask is that the amounts of weight redundancy can be learned automatically via our constraint and thus we avoid the problem of tuning pruning rates individually for different layers in a network. Extensive experimental results on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet demonstrate that our method is highly effective, and can outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin, especially in the high pruning rate situation. Notably, the gap of Top-1 accuracy between our ProbMask and existing methods can be up to 10%.

Deep learning based methods learning the mappings between the compressive images and the HSIs directly achieved much better results.

However, the similarity of the outputs cannot guarantee the accuracy of target samples, i.e., traget samples may match to wrong categories even if the discrepancy between two classifiers is small. To challenge this issue, in this paper, we propose a cross-domain gradient discrepancy minimization (CGDM) method which explicitly minimizes the discrepancy of gradients generated by source samples and target samples. Specifically, the gradient gives a cue for the semantic information of target samples so it can be used as a good supervision to improve the accuracy of target samples.

To reduce the required amount of supervision, we propose 3DIoUMatch, a novel semi-supervised method for 3D object detection applicable to both indoor and outdoor scenes. We leverage a teacher-student mutual learning framework to propagate information from the labeled to the unlabeled train set in the form of pseudo-labels. However, due to the high task complexity, we observe that the pseudo-labels suffer from significant noise and are thus not directly usable. To that end, we introduce a confidence-based filtering mechanism, inspired by FixMatch. We set confidence thresholds based upon the predicted objectness and class probability to filter low-quality pseudo-labels. While effective, we observe that these two measures do not sufficiently capture localization quality. We therefore propose to use the estimated 3D IoU as a localization metric and set category-aware self-adjusted thresholds to filter poorly localized proposals. We adopt VoteNet as our backbone detector on indoor datasets while we use PV-RCNN on the autonomous driving dataset, KITTI. Our method consistently improves state-of-the-art methods on both ScanNet and SUN-RGBD benchmarks by significant margins under all label ratios (including fully labeled setting). For example, when training using only 10% labeled data on ScanNet, 3DIoUMatch achieves 7.7 absolute improvement on mAP@0.25 and 8.5 absolute improvement on mAP@0.5 upon the prior art.

Previous methods enforce independent gradient constraints for different tasks, while we consider these gradients contain complex information, and propose to leverage inter-task information by gradient decomposition. In particular, the gradient of an old task is decomposed into a part shared by all old tasks and a part specific to that task. The gradient for update should be close to the gradient of the new task, consistent with the gradients shared by all old tasks, and orthogonal to the space spanned by the gradients specific to the old tasks.

In this paper, we study VSR from an exotic perspective, by explicitly looking into the role of temporal frequency of video frames. Through experiments, we observe that a higher frequency, and hence a smaller pixel displacement between consecutive frames, tends to deliver favorable super-resolved results. This discovery motivates us to introduce Event Cameras, a novel sensing device that responds instantly to pixel intensity changes and produces up to millions of asynchronous events per second, to facilitate VSR. To this end, we propose an Event-based VSR framework (E-VSR), of which the key component is an asynchronous interpolation (EAI) module that reconstructs a high-frequency (HF) video stream with uniform and tiny pixel displacements between neighboring frames from an event stream. The derived HF video stream is then encoded into a VSR module to recover the desired HR videos. Furthermore, an LR bi-directional interpolation loss and an HR self-supervision loss are also introduced to respectively regulate the EAI and VSR modules.

Several recent approaches have successfully leveraged the idea of making such a representation invariant under different types of perturbations, especially via contrastive-based instance discrimination training. Although effective visual representations should indeed exhibit such invariances, there are other important characteristics, such as encoding contextual reasoning skills, for which alternative reconstruction-based approaches might be better suited. With this in mind, we propose a teacher-student scheme to learn representations by training a convolutional net to reconstruct a bag-of-visual-words (BoW) representation of an image, given as input a perturbed version of that same image. Our strategy performs an online training of both the teacher network (whose role is to generate the BoW targets) and the student network (whose role is to learn representations), along with an online update of the visual-words vocabulary (used for the BoW targets).

Our contribution is twofold. First, we find that a feature extractor trained on the labeled set generates representations in which a generic query sample and its neighbors are likely to share the same class. We exploit this observation to retrieve and aggregate pseudo positive pairs with contrastive learning, thus encouraging the model to learn more discriminative representations. Second, we notice that most of the instances are easily discriminated by the network, contributing less to the contrastive loss.

To demonstrate this, we present SimPoE, a Simulation-based approach for 3D human Pose Estimation, which integrates image-based kinematic inference and physics-based dynamics modeling. SimPoE learns a policy that takes as input the current-frame pose estimate and the next image frame to control a physically-simulated character to output the next-frame pose estimate. The policy contains a learnable kinematic pose refinement unit that uses 2D keypoints to iteratively refine its kinematic pose estimate of the next frame. Based on this refined kinematic pose, the policy learns to compute dynamics-based control (e.g., joint torques) of the character to advance the current-frame pose estimate to the pose estimate of the next frame. This design couples the kinematic pose refinement unit with the dynamics-based control generation unit, which are learned jointly with reinforcement learning to achieve accurate and physically-plausible pose estimation.

Specifically, DirectionNet factorizes relative camera pose, specified by a 3D rotation and a translation direction, into a set of 3D direction vectors. Since 3D directions can be identified with points on the sphere, DirectionNet estimates discrete distributions on the sphere as its output. We evaluate our model on challenging synthetic and real pose estimation datasets constructed from Matterport3D and InteriorNet.

Mitra"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 4639-4648","Maps are arguably one of the most fundamental concepts used to define and operate on manifold surfaces in differentiable geometry. Accordingly, in geometry processing, maps are ubiquitous and are used in many core applications, such as paramterization, shape analysis, remeshing, and deformation. Unfortunately, most computational representations of surface maps do not lend themselves to manipulation and optimization, usually entailing hard, discrete problems. While algorithms exist to solve these problems, they are problem-specific, and a general framework for surface maps is still in need. In this paper, we advocate to consider neural networks as encoding surface maps. Since neural networks can be composed on one another and are differentiable, we show it is easy to use them to define surfaces via atlases, compose them for surface-to-surface mappings, and optimize differentiable objectives relating to them, such as any notion of distortion, in a trivial manner. In our experiments, we represent surfaces by generating a neural map that approximates a UV parameterization of a 3D model. Then, we compose this map with other neural maps which we optimize with respect to distortion measures. We show that our formulation enables trivial optimization of rather elusive mapping tasks, such as maps between a collection of surfaces.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Morreale_Neural_Surface_Maps_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Existing point cloud completion methods tend to generate global shape skeletons and hence lack fine local details. Furthermore, they mostly learn a deterministic partial-to-complete mapping, but overlook structural relations in man-made objects. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a variational framework, Variational Relational point Completion network (VRCNet) with two appealing properties: 1) Probabilistic Modeling. In particular, we propose a dual-path architecture to enable principled probabilistic modeling across partial and complete clouds. One path consumes complete point clouds for reconstruction by learning a point VAE. The other path generates complete shapes for partial point clouds, whose embedded distribution is guided by distribution obtained from the reconstruction path during training. 2) Relational Enhancement. Specifically, we carefully design point self-attention kernel and point selective kernel module to exploit relational point features, which refines local shape details conditioned on the coarse completion. In addition, we contribute a multi-view partial point cloud dataset (MVP dataset) containing over 100,000 high-quality scans, which renders partial 3D shapes from 26 uniformly distributed camera poses for each 3D CAD model.

The inevitable variation in the instance scales can lead bottom-up methods to become particularly sensitive to hyper-parameter values. To this end, we propose instead a dynamic, proposal-free, data-driven approach that generates the appropriate convolution kernels to apply in response to the nature of the instances. To make the kernels discriminative, we explore a large context by gathering homogeneous points that share identical semantic categories and have close votes for the geometric centroids.

A latent code is easily to be interpreted if it would consistently impact a certain subarea of the resulting generated image. We thus propose to learn a spatial mask to localize the effect of each individual latent dimension. On the other hand, interpretability usually comes from latent dimensions that capture simple and basic variations in data. We thus impose a perturbation on a certain dimension of the latent code, and expect to identify the perturbation along this dimension from the generated images so that the encoding of simple variations can be enforced. Additionally, we develop an unsupervised model selection method, which accumulates perceptual distance scores along axes in the latent space.

We decompose the sample similarity computation into two stage, i.e., the intra-camera and inter-camera computations, respectively. The intra-camera computation directly leverages the CNN features for similarity computation within each camera. Pseudo-labels generated on different cameras train the re-id model in a multi-branch network.

We systematically evaluate different teacher and student models, metric learning and knowledge transfer loss functions on the new asymmetric testing as well as the standard symmetric testing task, where database and queries are represented by the same model. We find that plain regression is surprisingly effective compared to more complex knowledge transfer mechanisms, working best in asymmetric testing. Interestingly, our asymmetric metric learning approach works best in symmetric testing, allowing the student to even outperform the teacher. Our implementation is publicly available, including trained student models for all loss functions and all pairs of teacher/student models. This can serve as a benchmark for future research.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Budnik_Asymmetric_Metric_Learning_for_Knowledge_Transfer_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Frequency-Aware Discriminative Feature Learning Supervised by Single-Center Loss for Face Forgery Detection,"Jiaming Li, Hongtao Xie, Jiahong Li, Zhongyuan Wang, Yongdong Zhang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 6458-6467","Face forgery detection is raising ever-increasing interest in computer vision since facial manipulation technologies cause serious worries. Though recent works have reached sound achievements, there are still unignorable problems: a) learned features supervised by softmax loss are separable but not discriminative enough, since softmax loss does not explicitly encourage intra-class compactness and interclass separability; and b) fixed filter banks and hand-crafted features are insufficient to capture forgery patterns of frequency from diverse inputs. To compensate for such limitations, a novel frequency-aware discriminative feature learning framework is proposed in this paper. Specifically, we design a novel single-center loss (SCL) that only compresses intra-class variations of natural faces while boosting interclass differences in the embedding space. In such a case, the network can learn more discriminative features with less optimization difficulty. Besides, an adaptive frequency feature generation module is developed to mine frequency clues in a completely data-driven fashion. With the above two modules, the whole framework can learn more discriminative features in an end-to-end manner.

However, reconstructing a 3D caricature from a 2D caricature image remains a challenging task, mostly due to the lack of data. We propose to fill this gap by introducing 3DCaricShop, the first large-scale 3D caricature dataset that contains 2000 high-quality diversified 3D caricatures manually crafted by professional artists. 3DCaricShop also provides rich annotations including a paired 2D caricature image, camera parameters, and 3D facial landmarks. To demonstrate the advantage of 3DCaricShop, we present a novel baseline approach for single-view 3D caricature reconstruction. To ensure a faithful reconstruction with plausible face deformations, we propose to connect the good ends of the detail-rich implicit functions and the parametric mesh representations. In particular, we first register a template mesh to the output of the implicit generator and iteratively project the registration result onto a pre-trained PCA space to resolve artifacts and self-intersections. To deal with the large deformation during non-rigid registration, we propose a novel view-collaborative graph convolution network (VC-GCN) to extract key points from the implicit mesh for accurate alignment. Our method is able to generate high-fidelity 3D caricature in a pre-defined mesh topology that is animation-ready.

But they require an extra fine-tuning stage, and the disjointed optimization of representation and classifier might lead to suboptimal results. However, end-to-end training methods, like equalization loss (EQL), still perform worse than decoupled training methods. In this paper, we reveal the main issue in long-tailed object detection is the imbalanced gradients between positives and negatives, and find that EQL does not solve it well.

Introducing the dynamic range to deep metric learning, we get a novel computer vision task, i.e., the Dynamic Metric Learning. Dynamic Metric Learning aims to learn a scalable metric space to accommodate visual concepts across multiple semantic scales. Based on three different types of images, i.e., vehicle, animal and online products, we construct three datasets for Dynamic Metric Learning.

The major difficulty lies in a conflict between different scales: the discriminative ability under a small scale usually compromises the discriminative ability under a large one, and vice versa.

On the Difficulty of Membership Inference Attacks,"Shahbaz Rezaei, Xin Liu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 7892-7900","Recent studies propose membership inference (MI) attacks on deep models, where the goal is to infer if a sample has been used in the training process. Despite their apparent success, these studies only report accuracy, precision, and recall of the positive class (member class). Hence, the performance of these attacks have not been clearly reported on negative class (non-member class). In this paper, we show that the way the MI attack performance has been reported is often misleading because they suffer from high false positive rate or false alarm rate (FAR) that has not been reported. FAR shows how often the attack model mislabel non-training samples (non-member) as training (member) ones. The high FAR makes MI attacks fundamentally impractical, which is particularly more significant for tasks such as membership inference where the majority of samples in reality belong to the negative (non-training) class. Moreover, we show that the current MI attack models can only identify the membership of misclassified samples with mediocre accuracy at best, which only constitute a very small portion of training samples. We analyze several new features that have not been comprehensively explored for membership inference before, including distance to the decision boundary and gradient norms, and conclude that deep models' responses are mostly similar among train and non-train samples. We conduct several experiments on image classification tasks, including MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, using various model architecture, including LeNet, AlexNet, ResNet, etc. We show that the current state-of-the-art MI attacks cannot achieve high accuracy and low FAR at the same time, even when the attacker is given several advantages.

However, how to automatically decide the trust degree of a learner as training goes is not well answered in the literature? (2) Some methods penalise while the others reward low-entropy predictions, prompting us to ask which one is better? To resolve the first issue, taking two well-accepted propositions-deep neural networks learn meaningful patterns before fitting noise (Arpit et al., 2017) and minimum entropy regularisation principle (Grandvalet & Bengio, 2006)-we propose a novel end-to-end method named ProSelfLC, which is designed according to learning time and entropy. Specifically, given a data point, we progressively increase trust in its predicted label distribution versus its annotated one if a model has been trained for enough time and the prediction is of low entropy (high confidence). For the second issue, according to ProSelfLC, we empirically prove that it is better to redefine a meaningful low-entropy status and optimise the learner toward it. This serves as a defence of entropy minimisation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProSelfLC through extensive experiments in both clean and noisy settings.

Because documents are multimodal and are intended for sequential reading, our framework exploits the positional, textual, and visual information of every semantically meaningful component in a document, and it models the contextualization between each block of content. Unlike existing document pre-training models, our model is coarse-grained instead of treating individual words as input, therefore avoiding an overly fine-grained with excessive contextualization. Beyond that, we introduce cross-modal learning in the model pre-training phase to fully leverage multimodal information from unlabeled documents. For downstream usage, we propose a novel modality-adaptive attention mechanism for multimodal feature fusion by adaptively emphasizing language and vision signals. Our framework benefits from self-supervised pre-training on documents without requiring annotations by a feature masking training strategy. It achieves superior performance on multiple downstream tasks with significantly fewer document images used in the pre-training stage compared to previous works.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Li_SelfDoc_Self-Supervised_Document_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

However, current approaches are still based on conventional energy optimization and are developed for static scenes. To enable learning-based approaches to address real-world RSCD problem, we contribute the first dataset, BS-RSCD, which includes both ego-motion and object-motion in dynamic scenes. Real distorted and blurry videos with corresponding ground truth are recorded simultaneously via a beam-splitter-based acquisition system. Since direct application of existing individual rolling shutter correction (RSC) or global shutter deblurring (GSD) methods on RSCD leads to undesirable results due to inherent flaws in the network architecture, we further present the first learning-based model (JCD) for RSCD.

To be specific, our VSPW is featured from the following aspects: 1) Well-trimmed long-temporal clips. Each video contains a complete shot, lasting around 5 seconds on average. 2) Dense annotation. The pixel-level annotations are provided at a high frame rate of 15 f/s. 3) High resolution. Over 96% of the captured videos are with high spatial resolutions from 720P to 4K. We totally annotate 3,337 videos, including 239,934 frames from 124 categories. To the best of our knowledge, our VSPW is the first attempt to tackle the challenging video scene parsing task in the wild by considering diverse scenarios. Based on VSPW, we design a generic Temporal Context Blending (TCB) network, which can effectively harness long-range contextual information from the past frames to help segment the current one. Extensive experiments show that our TCB network improves both the segmentation performance and temporal stability comparing with image-/video-based state-of-the-art methods.

Compared to the standard multi-class case (where each image has only one label), it is considerably more challenging to annotate training data for multi-label classification. When the number of potential labels is large, human annotators find it difficult to mention all applicable labels for each training image. Furthermore, in some settings detection is intrinsically difficult e.g. finding small object instances in high resolution images. As a result, multi-label training data is often plagued by false negatives. We consider the hardest version of this problem, where annotators provide only one relevant label for each image. As a result, training sets will have only one positive label per image and no confirmed negatives. We explore this special case of learning from missing labels across four different multi-label image classification datasets for both linear classifiers and end-to-end fine-tuned deep networks. We extend existing multi-label losses to this setting and propose novel variants that constrain the number of expected positive labels during training.

In this work, we propose the Decoupled Dynamic Filter (DDF) that can simultaneously tackle both of these shortcomings. Inspired by recent advances in attention, DDF decouples a depth-wise dynamic filter into spatial and channel dynamic filters. This decomposition considerably reduces the number of parameters and limits computational costs to the same level as depth-wise convolution. Meanwhile, we observe a significant boost in performance when replacing standard convolution with DDF in classification networks. ResNet50 / 101 get improved by 1.9% and 1.3% on the top-1 accuracy, while their computational costs are reduced by nearly half.

We first analyze DC accelerators and find that existing CNNs suffer from insufficient operational intensity, parallelism, and execution efficiency and exhibit FLOPs-latency nonproportionality. These insights let us create a DC-accelerator-optimized search space, with space-to-depth, space-to-batch, hybrid fused convolution structures with vanilla and depthwise convolutions, and block-wise activation functions.

For a given image, the proposed approach generates a universal adversarial perturbation to simultaneously attack all the occurred objects in the image through jointly maximizing the respective loss for each object.

The MC samples, which are nothing but different super-resolved images using different stochastic parameters, reconstruct the image, and provide a confidence or uncertainty map of the reconstruction. We propose a faster approach for MC sample generation, and it allows the variable image size during testing. Therefore, it will be useful for image reconstruction domain. Our experimental findings show that this uncertainty map strongly relates to the quality of reconstruction generated by the deep CNN model and explains its limitation. Furthermore, this paper proposes an approach to reduce the model's uncertainty for an input image, and it helps to defend the adversarial attacks on the image super-resolution model. The proposed uncertainty reduction technique also improves the performance of the model for out-of-distribution test images.

By assuming that the source and target domains share consistent key feature representations and identical label space, existing studies on MSDA typically utilize the entire union set of features from both the source and target domains to obtain the feature map and align the map for each category and domain. However, the default setting of MSDA may neglect the issue of ""partialness"", i.e., 1) a part of the features contained in the union set of multiple source domains may not present in the target domain; 2) the label space of the target domain may not completely overlap with the multiple source domains. In this paper, we unify the above two cases to a more generalized MSDA task as Multi-Source Partial Domain Adaptation (MSPDA). We propose a novel model termed Partial Feature Selection and Alignment (PFSA) to jointly cope with both MSDA and MSPDA tasks. Specifically, we firstly employ a feature selection vector based on the correlation among the features of multiple sources and target domains. We then design three effective feature alignment losses to jointly align the selected features by preserving the domain information of the data sample clusters in the same category and the discrimination between different classes.

Meyer," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 5261-5269","The Huber loss is a robust loss function used for a wide range of regression tasks. To utilize the Huber loss, a parameter that controls the transitions from a quadratic function to an absolute value function needs to be selected. We believe the standard probabilistic interpretation that relates the Huber loss to the Huber density fails to provide adequate intuition for identifying the transition point. As a result, a hyper-parameter search is often necessary to determine an appropriate value. In this work, we propose an alternative probabilistic interpretation of the Huber loss, which relates minimizing the loss to minimizing an upper-bound on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between Laplace distributions, where one distribution represents the noise in the ground-truth and the other represents the noise in the prediction. In addition, we show that the parameters of the Laplace distributions are directly related to the transition point of the Huber loss. We demonstrate, through a toy problem, that the optimal transition point of the Huber loss is closely related to the distribution of the noise in the ground-truth data. As a result, our interpretation provides an intuitive way to identify well-suited hyper-parameters by approximating the amount of noise in the data, which we demonstrate through a case study and experimentation on the Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet object detectors.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Meyer_An_Alternative_Probabilistic_Interpretation_of_the_Huber_Loss_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Discrimination-Aware Mechanism for Fine-Grained Representation Learning,"Furong Xu, Meng Wang, Wei Zhang, Yuan Cheng, Wei Chu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 813-822","Recently, with the emergence of retrieval requirements for certain individual in the same superclass, e.g., birds, persons, cars, fine-grained recognition task has attracted a significant amount of attention from academia and industry. In fine-grained recognition scenario, the inter-class differences are quite diverse and subtle, which makes it challenging to extract all the discriminative cues. Traditional training mechanism optimizes the overall discriminativeness of the whole feature. It may stop early when some feature elements has been trained to distinguish training samples well, leaving other elements insufficiently trained for a feature. This would result in a less generalizable feature extractor that only captures major discriminative cues and ignores subtle ones. Therefore, there is a need for a training mechanism that enforces the discriminativeness of all the elements in the feature to capture more the subtle visual cues. In this paper, we propose a Discrimination-Aware Mechanism (DAM) that iteratively identifies insufficiently trained elements and improves them. DAM is able to increase the number of well learned elements, which captures more visual cues by the feature extractor. In this way, a more informative representation is learned, which brings better generalization performance. We show that DAM can be easily applied to both proxy-based and pair-based loss functions, and thus can be used in most existing fine-grained recognition paradigms. Comprehensive experiments on CUB-200-2011, Cars196, Market-1501, and MSMT17 datasets demonstrate the advantages of our DAM based loss over the related state-of-the-art approaches.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Xu_Discrimination-Aware_Mechanism_for_Fine-Grained_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Thus, simultaneously capturing the transient variation and the motion trend is the key to make spacetime-varying motions more predictable. Based on these observations, we propose the MotionRNN framework, which can capture the complex variations within motions and adapt to spacetime-varying scenarios.

However, the illuminant invariant assumption conflicts with the nature of the color constancy task, which aims to estimate the illuminant given a raw image. Therefore, we construct effective contrastive pairs for learning better illuminant-dependent features via a novel raw-domain color augmentation. On the NUS-8 dataset, our method provides 17.5% relative improvements over a strong baseline, reaching state-of-the-art performance without increasing model complexity. Furthermore, our method achieves competitive performance on the Gehler dataset with 3x fewer parameters compared to top-ranking deep learning methods. More importantly, we show that our model is more robust to different scenes under close proximity of illuminants, significantly reducing 28.7% worst-case error in data-sparse regions.

Dual Attention Suppression Attack: Generate Adversarial Camouflage in Physical World,"Jiakai Wang, Aishan Liu, Zixin Yin, Shunchang Liu, Shiyu Tang, Xianglong Liu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 8565-8574","Deep learning models are vulnerable to adversarial examples. As a more threatening type for practical deep learning systems, physical adversarial examples have received extensive research attention in recent years. However, without exploiting the intrinsic characteristics such as model-agnostic and human-specific patterns, existing works generate weak adversarial perturbations in the physical world, which fall short of attacking across different models and show visually suspicious appearance. Motivated by the viewpoint that attention reflects the intrinsic characteristics of the recognition process, this paper proposes the Dual Attention Suppression (DAS) attack to generate visually-natural physical adversarial camouflage with strong transferability by suppressing both model and human attention. As for attacking, we generate transferable adversarial camouflages by distracting the model-shared similar attention patterns from the target to non-target regions. Meanwhile, based on the fact that human visual attention always focuses on salient items (e.g., suspicious distortions), we evade the human-specific bottom-up attention to generate visually-natural camouflage which is correlated to the scenario context. We conduct extensive experiments in both the digital and physical world for classification and detection tasks on up to date models (e.g., Yolo-V5) and significantly demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Wang_Dual_Attention_Suppression_Attack_Generate_Adversarial_Camouflage_in_Physical_World_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

In this paper, we propose a new approach to train on both uniform and re-balanced samplings in a collaborative way, resulting in performance improvement on both head and tail classes. More specifically, we design a visual recognition network with two branches: one takes the uniform sampling as input while the other takes the re-balanced sampling as the input. For each branch, we conduct visual recognition using a binary-cross-entropy-based classification loss with learnable logit compensation. We further define a new cross-branch loss to enforce the consistency when the same input image goes through the two branches. We conduct extensive experiments on VOC-LT and COCO-LT datasets.

Recently, data-free quantization has been widely studied as a practical and promising solution. It synthesizes data for calibrating the quantized model according to the batch normalization (BN) statistics of FP32 ones and significantly relieves the heavy dependency on real training data in traditional quantization methods. Unfortunately, we find that in practice, the synthetic data identically constrained by BN statistics suffers serious homogenization at both distribution level and sample level and further causes a significant performance drop of the quantized model. We propose Diverse Sample Generation (DSG) scheme to mitigate the adverse effects caused by homogenization.

In this paper, we present a new system for solving the second sub-problem. Central to our approach is a new geometric representation: the zone graph. Zones are the set of solid regions formed by extending all B-Rep faces and partitioning space with them; a zone graph has these zones as its nodes, with edges denoting geometric adjacencies between them.

However, perspective effects stemming from the projection in a conventional camera vary for different global positions in the image. We introduce Perspective Crop Layers (PCLs) -- a form of perspective crop of the region of interest based on the camera geometry -- and show that accounting for the perspective consistently improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art 3D pose reconstruction methods. PCLs are modular neural network layers, which, when inserted into existing CNN and MLP architectures, deterministically remove the location-dependent perspective effects while leaving end-to-end training and the number of parameters of the underlying neural network unchanged. We demonstrate that PCL leads to improved 3D human pose reconstruction accuracy for CNN architectures that use cropping operations, such as spatial transformer networks (STN), and, somewhat surprisingly, MLPs used for 2D-to-3D keypoint lifting. Our conclusion is that it is important to utilize camera calibration information when available, for classical and deep-learning-based computer vision alike.

To solve such a less-touched problem without the help of labels, we propose simultaneously learning representation and aligning data using a noise-robust contrastive loss. In brief, for each sample from one view, our method aims to identify its within-category counterparts from other views, and thus the cross-view correspondence could be established. As the contrastive learning needs data pairs as input, we construct positive pairs using the known correspondences and negative pairs using random sampling. To alleviate or even eliminate the influence of the false negatives caused by random sampling, we propose a noise-robust contrastive loss that could adaptively prevent the false negatives from dominating the network optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this could be the first successful attempt of enabling contrastive learning robust to noisy labels. In fact, this work might remarkably enrich the learning paradigm with noisy labels. More specifically, the traditional noisy labels are defined as incorrect annotations for the supervised tasks such as classification. In contrast, this work proposes that the view correspondence might be false, which is remarkably different from the widely-accepted definition of noisy label.

It is found that the input latent space shows semantic correlations with the output image space. Recent works aim to interpret the latent space and discover meaningful directions that correspond to human interpretable image transformations. However, these methods either rely on explicit scores of attributes (e.g., memorability) or are restricted to binary ones (e.g., gender), which largely limits the applicability of editing tasks, especially for free-form artistic tasks like style/anime editing. In this paper, we propose an adversarial method, AdvStyle, for discovering interpretable directions in the absence of well-labeled scores or binary attributes. In particular, the proposed adversarial method simultaneously optimizes the discovered directions and the attribute assessor using the target attribute data as positive samples, while the generated ones being negative. In this way, arbitrary attributes can be edited by collecting positive data only, and the proposed method learns a controllable representation enabling manipulation of non-binary attributes like anime styles and facial characteristics. Moreover, the proposed learning strategy attenuates the entanglement between attributes, such that multiattribute manipulation can be easily achieved without any additional constraint. Furthermore, we reveal several interesting semantics with the involuntarily learned negative directions. Extensive experiments on 9 anime attributes and 7 human attributes demonstrate the effectiveness of our adversarial approach qualitatively and quantitatively.

Then, we resize object regions to a fixed scale to estimate poses once again. In this fashion, we eliminate large scale variations and focus on rotation estimation, thus facilitating pose estimation. Moreover, we exploit the initial pose estimation to generate pseudo ground-truth to train our DSC-PoseNet in a self-supervised manner. The estimation results in these two scales are ensembled as our final pose estimation. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art models trained on synthetic data by a large margin and even is on par with several fully-supervised methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Yang_DSC-PoseNet_Learning_6DoF_Object_Pose_Estimation_via_Dual-Scale_Consistency_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

The GNAS can automatically learn better architecture with the optimal depth of message passing on the graph. Specifically, we design Graph Neural Architecture Paradigm (GAP) with tree-topology computation procedure and two types of fine-grained atomic operations (feature filtering & neighbor aggregation) from message-passing mechanism to construct powerful graph network search space. Feature filtering performs adaptive feature selection, and neighbor aggregation captures structural information and calculates neighbors' statistics.

Previous methods usually focus on designing an implicit and recurrent feature interaction mechanism to fuse the visual-linguistic features to directly generate the final segmentation mask without explicitly modeling the localization of the referent guided by language expression and designing a powerful segmentation module. To tackle these problems, we view this task from another perspective by decoupling it into a ""locate-then-segment"" (LTS) scheme. Given a language expression, people generally first perform attention to the corresponding target image regions, then generate a segmentation mask about the object based on its context. The LTS first extracts and fuses both visual and textual features to get a cross-modal representation, then applies a cross-model interaction on the visual-textual features to locate the referred object with position prior, and finally generates the segmentation result with a light-weight network. Our LTS is simple but surprisingly effective. On three popular benchmark datasets, the LTS outperforms all the previous state-of-the-arts methods by a large margin (e.g., +3.2% on RefCOCO+ and +3.4% on RefCOCOg).

Few-shot learning (FSL) is the dominant approach to address this issue, where the objective is to quickly adapt to novel categories in presence of a limited number of samples. FSL tasks have been predominantly solved by leveraging the ideas from gradient-based meta-learning and metric learning approaches. However, recent works have demonstrated the significance of powerful feature representations with a simple embedding network that can outperform existing sophisticated FSL algorithms. In this work, we build on this insight and propose a novel training mechanism that simultaneously enforces equivariance and invariance to a general set of geometric transformations. Equivariance or invariance has been employed standalone in the previous works; however, to the best of our knowledge, they have not been used jointly. Simultaneous optimization for both of these contrasting objectives allows the model to jointly learn features that are not only independent of the input transformation but also the features that encode the structure of geometric transformations. These complementary sets of features help generalize well to novel classes with only a few data samples.

This adaptivity to unseen classes is especially important for many practical applications where the pre-trained label space cannot remain fixed for effective use and the model needs to be ""specialized"" to support new categories on the fly. One particularly interesting scenario, essentially overlooked by the few-shot literature, is Coarse-to-Fine Few-Shot (C2FS), where the training classes (e.g. animals) are of much `coarser granularity' than the target (test) classes (e.g. breeds).

The information inside these two visual domains is well complementary, e.g., 2D images have fine-grained texture while 3D point clouds contain plentiful geometry information. However, most current visual recognition systems process them individually. In this paper, we present a bidirectional projection network (BPNet) for joint 2D and 3D reasoning in an end-to-end manner. It contains 2D and 3D sub-networks with symmetric architectures, that are connected by our proposed bidirectional projection module (BPM).

Extensive quantitative and qualitative experimental evaluations show that joint reasoning over 2D and 3D visual domains can benefit both 2D and 3D scene understanding simultaneously.

However, very dense occlusions and extreme lighting conditions may bring significant disturbances to the SAI based on conventional frame-based cameras, leading to performance degeneration. To address these problems, we propose a novel SAI system based on the event camera which can produce asynchronous events with extremely low latency and high dynamic range. Thus, it can eliminate the interference of dense occlusions by measuring with almost continuous views, and simultaneously tackle the over/under exposure problems. To reconstruct the occluded targets, we propose a hybrid encoder-decoder network composed of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In the hybrid network, the spatio-temporal information of the collected events is first encoded by SNN layers, and then transformed to the visual image of the occluded targets by a style-transfer CNN decoder.

In contrast, Probabilistic NAS, such as PARSEC, learns a distribution over high-performing architectures, and uses only as much memory as needed to train a single model. Nevertheless, it needs to sample many architectures, making it computationally expensive for searching in an extensive space. To solve these problems, we propose a sampling method adaptive to the distribution entropy, drawing more samples to encourage explorations at the beginning, and reducing samples as learning proceeds. Furthermore, to search fast in the multi-variate space, we propose a coarse-to-fine strategy by using a factorized distribution at the beginning which can reduce the number of architecture parameters by over an order of magnitude. We call this method Fast Probabilistic NAS (FP-NAS). Compared with PARSEC, it can sample 64% fewer architectures and search 2.1x faster. Compared with FBNetV2, FP-NAS is 1.9x - 3.5x faster, and the searched models outperform FBNetV2 models on ImageNet. FP-NAS allows us to expand the giant FBNetV2 space to be wider (i.e. larger channel choices) and deeper (i.e. more blocks), while adding Split-Attention block and enabling the search over the number of splits. When searching a model of size 0.4G FLOPS, FP-NAS is 132x faster than EfficientNet, and the searched FP-NAS-L0 model outperforms EfficientNet-B0 by 0.7% accuracy.

Firstly, most of them do not sufficiently model the characteristics of rain layers of rainy videos. In fact, the rain layers exhibit strong physical properties (e.g., direction, scale and thickness) in spatial dimension and natural continuities in temporal dimension, and thus can be generally modelled by the spatial-temporal process in statistics. Secondly, current DL-based methods seriously depend on the labeled synthetic training data, whose rain types are always deviated from those in unlabeled real data. Such gap between synthetic and real data sets leads to poor performance when applying them in real scenarios.

We formulate an optimization task that converts random noise into natural images, matching gradients while regularizing image fidelity. We also propose an algorithm for target class label recovery given gradients. We further propose a group consistency regularization framework, where multiple agents starting from different random seeds work together to find an enhanced reconstruction of original data batch. We show that gradients encode a surprisingly large amount of information, such that all the individual images can be recovered with high fidelity via GradInversion, even for complex datasets, deep networks, and large batch sizes.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Yin_See_Through_Gradients_Image_Batch_Recovery_via_GradInversion_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Feature Decomposition and Reconstruction Learning for Effective Facial Expression Recognition,"Delian Ruan, Yan Yan, Shenqi Lai, Zhenhua Chai, Chunhua Shen, Hanzi Wang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 7660-7669","In this paper, we propose a novel Feature Decomposition and Reconstruction Learning (FDRL) method for effective facial expression recognition. We view the expression information as the combination of the shared information (expression similarities) across different expressions and the unique information (expression-specific variations) for each expression. More specifically, FDRL mainly consists of two crucial networks: a Feature Decomposition Network (FDN) and a Feature Reconstruction Network (FRN). In particular, FDN first decomposes the basic features extracted from a backbone network into a set of facial action-aware latent features to model expression similarities. Then, FRN captures the intra-feature and inter-feature relationships for latent features to characterize expression-specific variations, and reconstructs the expression feature. To this end, two modules including an intra-feature relation modeling module and an inter-feature relation modeling module are developed in FRN. Experimental results on both the in-the-lab databases (including CK+, MMI, and Oulu-CASIA) and the in-the-wild databases (including RAF-DB and SFEW) show that the proposed FDRL method consistently achieves higher recognition accuracy than several state-of-the-art methods.

Our key insight is that inferring the complete geometry of the objects significantly helps in tracking. By hallucinating unseen regions of objects, we can obtain additional correspondences between the same instance, thus providing robust tracking even under strong change of appearance. From a sequence of RGB-D frames, we detect objects in each frame and learn to predict their complete object geometry as well as a dense correspondence mapping into a canonical space. This allows us to derive 6DoF poses for the objects in each frame, along with their correspondence between frames, providing robust object tracking across the RGB-D sequence.

Most existing deep learning methods for this problem are supervised and trained by registered motion pairs. In addition, these methods are often limited to yielding a deterministic output, given a pair of style and content motions. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for motion style transfer by synthesizing stylized motions autoregressively using a generative flow model M. M is trained to maximize the exact likelihood of a collection of unlabeled motions, based on an autoregressive context of poses in previous frames and a control signal representing the movement of a root joint. Thanks to invertible flow transformations, latent codes that encode deep properties of motion styles are efficiently inferred by M. By combining the latent codes (from an input style motion S) with the autoregressive context and control signal (from an input content motion C), M outputs a stylized motion which transfers style from S to C. Moreover, our model is probabilistic and is able to generate various plausible motions with a specific style.

The major reason for this situation is that it is inappropriate and inefficient to apply multiple SOT models directly to the MOT task, although advanced SOT methods are of the strong discriminative power and can run at fast speeds. In this paper, we propose a novel and end-to-end trainable MOT architecture that extends CenterNet by adding an SOT branch for tracking objects in parallel with the existing branch for object detection, allowing the MOT task to benefit from the strong discriminative power of SOT methods in an effective and efficient way. Unlike most existing SOT methods which learn to distinguish the target object from its local backgrounds, the added SOT branch trains a separate SOT model per target online to distinguish the target from its surrounding targets, assigning SOT models the novel discrimination. Moreover, similar to the detection branch, the SOT branch treats objects as points, making its online learning efficient even if multiple targets are processed simultaneously. Without tricks, the proposed tracker achieves MOTAs of 0.710 and 0.686, IDF1s of 0.719 and 0.714, on MOT17 and MOT20 benchmarks, respectively, while running at 16 FPS on MOT17.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Zheng_Improving_Multiple_Object_Tracking_With_Single_Object_Tracking_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

However, due to the various appearances of real rain streaks that may be different from those in the synthetic training data, it is challenging to directly extend existing methods to the real-world scenes. To address this issue, we propose a memory-oriented semi-supervised (MOSS) method which enables the network to explore and exploit the properties of rain streaks from both synthetic and real data. The key aspect of our method is designing an encoder-decoder neural network that is augmented with a self-supervised memory module, where items in the memory record the prototypical patterns of rain degradations and are updated in a self-supervised way. Consequently, the rainy styles can be comprehensively derived from synthetic or real-world degraded images without the need for clean labels.

An additional target network, which is updated with an exponential moving average of the online deraining network, is utilized to produce pseudo-labels for unlabeled rainy images. Meanwhile, the deraining network is optimized with supervised objectives on both synthetic paired data and pseudo-paired noisy data.

Therefore, it is desirable to develop computational models that can automatically interpolate the in-between animation frames. However, existing video interpolation methods fail to produce satisfying results on animation data. Compared to natural videos, animation videos possess two unique characteristics that make frame interpolation difficult: 1) cartoons comprise lines and smooth color pieces. The smooth areas lack textures and make it difficult to estimate accurate motions on animation videos. 2) cartoons express stories via exaggeration. Some of the motions are non-linear and extremely large. In this work, we formally define and study the animation video interpolation problem for the first time. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose an effective framework, AnimeInterp, with two dedicated modules in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, 1) Segment-Guided Matching resolves the ""lack of textures"" challenge by exploiting global matching among color pieces that are piece-wise coherent. 2) Recurrent Flow Refinement resolves the ""non-linear and extremely large motion"" challenge by recurrent predictions using a transformer-like architecture.

Our method is capable of inferring fine-grained shape details as well as nearby objects whose semantic categories are easily mixedup. The key insight is that we decouple the instances from a coarsely completed semantic scene instead of a raw input image to guide the reconstruction of instances and the overall scene.

Safe, high speed driving needs larger detection ranges, which are enabled by new LiDARs. These larger detection ranges require more efficient and accurate detection models. Towards this goal, we propose Range Sparse Net (RSN) - a simple, efficient, and accurate 3D object detector - in order to tackle real time 3D object detection in this extended detection regime. RSN predicts foreground points from range images and applies sparse convolutions on the selected fore-ground points to detect objects. The lightweight 2D convolutions on dense range images results in significantly fewer selected foreground points, thus enabling the later sparse convolutions in RSN to efficiently operate. Combining features from the range image further enhance detection ac-curacy. RSN runs at more than 60 frames per second on a 150mx150m detection region on Waymo Open Dataset (WOD) while being more accurate than previously published detectors.

We use the trained model to predict HDRs for the unlabeled samples. To derive data for the next stage of training, we propose a novel method for generating corresponding dynamic inputs from the predicted HDRs of unlabeled data. The generated artificial dynamic inputs and predicted HDRs are used as paired labeled data.

In contrast to this practice, training STR models only on fewer real labels (STR with fewer labels) is important when we have to train STR models without synthetic data: for handwritten or artistic texts that are difficult to generate synthetically and for languages other than English for which we do not always have synthetic data. However, there has been implicit common knowledge that training STR models on real data is nearly impossible because real data is insufficient. We consider that this common knowledge has obstructed the study of STR with fewer labels. In this work, we would like to reactivate STR with fewer labels by disproving the common knowledge. We consolidate recently accumulated public real data and show that we can train STR models satisfactorily only with real labeled data. Subsequently, we find simple data augmentation to fully exploit real data. Furthermore, we improve the models by collecting unlabeled data and introducing semi- and self-supervised methods. As a result, we obtain a competitive model to state-of-the-art methods.

To overcome the problem of catastrophic forgetting, we propose utilizing an alternative ""white box"" architecture derived from the principle of rate reduction, where each layer of the network is explicitly computed without back propagation.

Learning HR representations is typically ignored in previous Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods that focus on image classification. This work proposes a novel NAS method, called HR-NAS, which is able to find efficient and accurate networks for different tasks, by effectively encoding multiscale contextual information while maintaining high-resolution representations. In HR-NAS, we renovate the NAS search space as well as its searching strategy. To better encode multiscale image contexts in the search space of HR-NAS, we first carefully design a lightweight transformer, whose computational complexity can be dynamically changed with respect to different objective functions and computation budgets. To maintain high-resolution representations of the learned networks, HR-NAS adopts a multi-branch architecture that provides convolutional encoding of multiple feature resolutions, inspired by HRNet. Last, we proposed an efficient fine-grained search strategy to train HR-NAS, which effectively explores the search space, and finds optimal architectures given various tasks and computation resources. HR-NAS is capable of achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance and FLOPs for three dense prediction tasks and an image classification task, given only small computational budgets. For example, HR-NAS surpasses SqueezeNAS that is specially designed for semantic segmentation by a large margin of 3.61% while improving efficiency by 45.9%.

Recent work has also proposed to use the Shapley value, as it defines a unique value distribution scheme that satisfies a set of appealing properties. However, calculating Shapley values is often expensive, which limits its applicability in real-world applications at scale. Multiple heuristics to improve the scalability of calculating Shapley values have been proposed recently, with the potential risk of compromising their utility in real-world applications.

While the input image can be of a smiling person or taken in extreme lighting conditions, our method can reliably produce a high-quality textured model of a person's face in neutral expression and skin textures under diffuse lighting condition. Cutting-edge 3D face reconstruction methods use non-linear morphable face models combined with GAN-based decoders to capture the likeness and details of a person but fail to produce neutral head models with unshaded albedo textures which is critical for creating relightable and animation-friendly avatars for integration in virtual environments. The key challenges for existing methods to work is the lack of training and ground truth data containing normalized 3D faces. We propose a two-stage approach to address this problem. First, we adopt a highly robust normalized 3D face generator by embedding a non-linear morphable face model into a StyleGAN2 network. This allows us to generate detailed but normalized facial assets. This inference is then followed by a perceptual refinement step that uses the generated assets as regularization to cope with the limited available training samples of normalized faces. We further introduce a Normalized Face Dataset, which consists of a combination photogrammetry scans, carefully selected photographs, and generated fake people with neutral expressions in diffuse lighting conditions. While our prepared dataset contains two orders of magnitude less subjects than cutting edge GAN-based 3D facial reconstruction methods, we show that it is possible to produce high-quality normalized face models for very challenging unconstrained input images, and demonstrate superior performance to the current state-of-the-art.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Luo_Normalized_Avatar_Synthesis_Using_StyleGAN_and_Perceptual_Refinement_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Hybrid Rotation Averaging: A Fast and Robust Rotation Averaging Approach,"Yu Chen, Ji Zhao, Laurent Kneip"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 10358-10367","We address rotation averaging (RA) and its application to real-world 3D reconstruction. Local optimisation based approaches are the de facto choice, though they only guarantee a local optimum. Global optimisers ensure global optimality in low noise conditions, but they are inefficient and may easily deviate under the influence of outliers or elevated noise levels. We push the envelope of rotation averaging by leveraging the advantages of a global RA method and a local RA method. Combined with a fast view graph filtering as preprocessing, the proposed hybrid approach is robust to outliers. We further apply the proposed hybrid rotation averaging approach to incremental Structure from Motion (SfM), the accuracy and robustness of SfM are both improved by adding the resulting global rotations as regularisers to bundle adjustment. Overall, we demonstrate high practicality of the proposed method as bad camera poses are effectively corrected and drift is reduced.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Chen_Hybrid_Rotation_Averaging_A_Fast_and_Robust_Rotation_Averaging_Approach_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

While some recent methods propose to train a 3D network with small percentages of point labels, we take the approach to an extreme and propose ""One Thing One Click,"" meaning that the annotator only needs to label one point per object. To leverage these extremely sparse labels in network training, we design a novel self-training approach, in which we iteratively conduct the training and label propagation, facilitated by a graph propagation module. Also, we adopt a relation network to generate per-category prototype and explicitly model the similarity among graph nodes to generate pseudo labels to guide the iterative training.

In this paper, we argue that OOD samples can be detected more easily if the training data is embedded into a low-dimensional space, such that the embedded training samples lie on a union of 1-dimensional subspaces. We show that such embedding of the in-distribution (ID) samples provides us with two main advantages. First, due to compact representation in the feature space, OOD samples are less likely to occupy the same region as the known classes. Second, the first singular vector of ID samples belonging to a 1-dimensional subspace can be used as their robust representative. Motivated by these observations, we train a deep neural network such that the ID samples are embedded onto a union of 1-dimensional subspaces. At the test time, employing sampling techniques used for approximate Bayesian inference in deep learning, input samples are detected as OOD if they occupy the region corresponding to the ID samples with probability 0. Spectral components of the ID samples are used as robust representative of this region. Our method does not have any hyperparameter to be tuned using extra information and it can be applied on different modalities with minimal change.

Unfortunately, building HD maps has proven hard to scale due to their cost as well as the requirements they impose in the localization system that has to work everywhere with centimeter-level accuracy. Being able to drive without an HD map would be very beneficial to scale self-driving solutions as well as to increase the failure tolerance of existing ones (e.g., if localization fails or the map is not up-to-date). Towards this goal, we propose an end-to-end approach to mapless driving where the input is raw sensor data and a high-level command (e.g., turn left at the intersection).

To enable learning, the choice of representation is the key. Recent work uses neural networks to parameterize local surface elements. This approach captures locally coherent geometry and non-planar details, can deal with varying topology, and does not require registered training data. However, naively using such methods to model 3D clothed humans fails to capture fine-grained local deformations and generalizes poorly. To address this, we present three key innovations: First, we deform surface elements based on a human body model such that large-scale deformations caused by articulation are explicitly separated from topological changes and local clothing deformations. Second, we address the limitations of existing neural surface elements by regressing local geometry from local features, significantly improving the expressiveness. Third, we learn a pose embedding on a 2D parameterization space that encodes posed body geometry, improving generalization to unseen poses by reducing non-local spurious correlations. We demonstrate the efficacy of our surface representation by learning models of complex clothing from point clouds. The clothing can change topology and deviate from the topology of the body. Once learned, we can animate previously unseen motions, producing high-quality point clouds, from which we generate realistic images with neural rendering. We assess the importance of each technical contribution and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and inference time.

Existing contrastive learning methods either maintain a queue of negative samples over mini-batches while only a small portion of them are updated in an iteration or only use the other examples from the current minibatch as negatives. They could not closely track the change of the learned representation over iterations by updating the entire queue as a whole or discard the useful information from the past mini-batches. Alternatively, we present to directly learn a set of negative adversaries playing against the self-trained representation. Two players, the representation network and negative adversaries are alternately updated to obtain the most challenging negative examples against which the representation of positive queries will be trained to discriminate.

In this context, vector quantization is an appealing framework that expresses multiple parameters using a single code, and has recently achieved state-of-the-art network compression on a range of core vision and natural language processing tasks. Key to the success of vector quantization is deciding which parameter groups should be compressed together. Previous work has relied on heuristics that group the spatial dimension of individual convolutional filters, but a general solution remains unaddressed. This is desirable for pointwise convolutions (which dominate modern architectures), linear layers (which have no notion of spatial dimension), and convolutions (when more than one filter is compressed to the same codeword). In this paper we make the observation that the weights of two adjacent layers can be permuted while expressing the same function. We then establish a connection to rate-distortion theory and search for permutations that result in networks that are easier to compress. Finally, we rely on an annealed quantization algorithm to better compress the network and achieve higher final accuracy. We show results on image classification, object detection, and segmentation, reducing the gap with the uncompressed model by 40 to 70% w.r.t. the current state of the art.

Object detection is already very challenging. It is even harder when the images are blurred, from the camera being in a car or a hand-held phone. Most existing efforts either focused on sharp images, with easy to label ground truth, or they have treated motion blur as one of many generic corruptions. Instead, we focus especially on the details of egomotion induced blur. We explore five classes of remedies, where each targets different potential causes for the performance gap between sharp and blurred images. For example, first deblurring an image changes its human interpretability, but at present, only partly improves object detection. The other four classes of remedies address multi-scale texture, out-of-distribution testing, label generation, and conditioning by blur-type. Surprisingly, we discover that custom label generation aimed at resolving spatial ambiguity, ahead of all others, markedly improves object detection. Also, in contrast to findings from classification, we see a noteworthy boost by conditioning our model on bespoke categories of motion blur. We validate and cross-breed the different remedies experimentally on blurred COCO images and real-world blur datasets, producing an easy and practical favorite model with superior detection rates.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Sayed_Improved_Handling_of_Motion_Blur_in_Online_Object_Detection_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Pre-training based meta-learning methods effectively tackle the problem by pre-training a feature extractor and then fine-tuning it through the nearest centroid based meta-learning. However, results show that the fine-tuning step makes very marginal improvements. In this paper, 1) we figure out the key reason, i.e., in the pre-trained feature space, the base classes already form compact clusters while novel classes spread as groups with large variances, which implies that fine-tuning the feature extractor is less meaningful; 2) instead of fine-tuning the feature extractor, we focus on estimating more representative prototypes during meta-learning.

Unfortunately, for many human activities (e.g. outdoor sports) such training data does not exist and is hard or even impossible to acquire with traditional motion capture systems. We propose a self-supervised approach that learns a single image 3D pose estimator from unlabeled multi-view data. To this end, we exploit multi-view consistency constraints to disentangle the observed 2D pose into the underlying 3D pose and camera rotation. In contrast to most existing methods, we do not require calibrated cameras and can therefore learn from moving cameras. Nevertheless, in the case of a static camera setup, we present an optional extension to include constant relative camera rotations over multiple views into our framework. Key to the success are new, unbiased reconstruction objectives that mix information across views and training samples.

A common assumption in studying visual navigation is that the environments are static; this is a limiting assumption. Intelligent navigation may involve interacting with the environment beyond just moving forward/backward and turning left/right. Sometimes, the best way to navigate is to push something out of the way. In this paper, we study the problem of interactive navigation where agents learn to change the environment to navigate more efficiently to their goals. To this end, we introduce the Neural Interaction Engine (NIE) to explicitly predict the change in the environment caused by the agent's actions. By modeling the changes while planning, we find that agents exhibit significant improvements in their navigational capabilities. More specifically, we consider two downstream tasks in the physics-enabled, visually rich, AI2-THOR environment: (1) reaching a target while the path to the target is blocked (2) moving an object to a target location by pushing it. For both tasks, agents equipped with an NIE significantly outperform agents without the understanding of the effect of the actions indicating the benefits of our approach.

Our core innovation is the learning of a region-phrase score function, based on which an image-sentence score function is further constructed. Importantly, our region-phrase score function is learned by distilling from soft matching scores between the detected object names and candidate phrases within an image-sentence pair, while the image-sentence score function is supervised by ground-truth image-sentence pairs. The design of such score functions removes the need of object detection at test time, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost.

A hurdle of training event-based models is the lack of large qualitative labeled data. Prior works learning end-tasks mostly rely on labeled or pseudo-labeled datasets obtained from the active pixel sensor (APS) frames; however, such datasets' quality is far from rivaling those based on the canonical images. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, called EvDistill, to learn a student network on the unlabeled and unpaired event data (target modality) via knowledge distillation (KD) from a teacher network trained with large labeled image data (source modality). To enable KD across the unpaired modalities, we first propose a bidirectional modality reconstruction (BMR) module to bridge both modalities and simultaneously exploit them to distill knowledge via the crafted pairs, causing no extra computation in the test time. The BMR is improved by the end-task and KD losses in an end-to-end manner. Second, we leverage the structural similarities of both modalities and adapt the knowledge by matching their distributions. Moreover, as most prior feature KD methods are uni-modality and less applicable to our problem, we propose an affinity graph KD and other losses to boost the distillation. Our extensive experiments on semantic segmentation and object recognition demonstrate that EvDistill achieves significantly better results than the prior works and KD with only events and APS frames.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Wang_EvDistill_Asynchronous_Events_To_End-Task_Learning_via_Bidirectional_Reconstruction-Guided_Cross-Modal_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

A consequence is that depth completion methods designed for LiDAR and video fare poorly for radar and video.

However, obtaining high-quality trimap itself is arduous, thus restricting the application of these methods. Recently, some trimap-free methods have emerged, however, the matting quality is still far behind the trimap-based methods. The main reason is that, without the trimap guidance in some cases, the target network is ambiguous about which is the foreground target. In fact, choosing the foreground is a subjective procedure and depends on the user's intention.

Recent works have shown that geometric deep learning can be used on mesh-based representations of proteins to identify potential functional sites, such as binding targets for potential drugs. Unfortunately though, the use of meshes as the underlying representation for protein structure has multiple drawbacks including the need to pre-compute the input features and mesh connectivities. This becomes a bottleneck for many important tasks in protein science. In this paper, we present a new framework for deep learning on protein structures that addresses these limitations. Among the key advantages of our method are the computation and sampling of the molecular surface on-the-fly from the underlying atomic point cloud and a novel efficient geometric convolutional layer. As a result, we are able to process large collections of proteins in an end-to-end fashion, taking as the sole input the raw 3D coordinates and chemical types of their atoms, eliminating the need for any hand-crafted pre-computed features. To showcase the performance of our approach, we test it on two tasks in the field of protein structural bioinformatics: the identification of interaction sites and the prediction of protein-protein interactions. On both tasks, we achieve state-of-the-art performance with much faster run times and fewer parameters than previous models.

This results in creates a commercially viable solution -- being exposed to the new style, the model has the best shot at adaptation, and the few-sample nature makes it practical to implement.

Unlike convolutions which are inherently parallel, the de-facto standard for NMS, namely GreedyNMS, cannot be easily parallelized and thus could be the performance bottleneck in convolutional object detection pipelines. MaxpoolNMS is introduced as a parallelizable alternative to GreedyNMS, which in turn enables faster speed than GreedyNMS at comparable accuracy. However, MaxpoolNMS is only capable of replacing the GreedyNMS at the first stage of two-stage detectors like Faster-RCNN. There is a significant drop in accuracy when applying MaxpoolNMS at the final detection stage, due to the fact that MaxpoolNMS fails to approximate GreedyNMS precisely in terms of bounding box selection. In this paper, we propose a general, parallelizable and configurable approach PSRR-MaxpoolNMS, to completely replace GreedyNMS at all stages in all detectors. By introducing a simple Relationship Recovery module and a Pyramid Shifted MaxpoolNMS module, our PSRR-MaxpoolNMS is able to approximate GreedyNMS more precisely than MaxpoolNMS. Comprehensive experiments show that our approach outperforms MaxpoolNMS by a large margin, and it is proven faster than GreedyNMS with comparable accuracy. For the first time, PSRR-MaxpoolNMS provides a fully parallelizable solution for customized hardware design, which can be reused for accelerating NMS everywhere.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Zhang_PSRR-MaxpoolNMS_Pyramid_Shifted_MaxpoolNMS_With_Relationship_Recovery_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Recent works have achieved surprisingly high retrieval accuracy on city-scale datasets. However, these results rely on the assumption that there exists a reference image exactly centered at the location of any query image, which is not applicable for practical scenarios. In this paper, we redefine this problem with a more realistic assumption that the query image can be arbitrary in the area of interest and the reference images are captured before the queries emerge. This assumption breaks the one-to-one retrieval setting of existing datasets as the queries and reference images are not perfectly aligned pairs, and there may be multiple reference images covering one query location. To bridge the gap between this realistic setting and existing datasets, we propose a new large-scale benchmark --VIGOR-- for cross-View Image Geo-localization beyond One-to-one Retrieval. We benchmark existing state-of-the-art methods and propose a novel end-to-end framework to localize the query in a coarse-to-fine manner. Apart from the image-level retrieval accuracy, we also evaluate the localization accuracy in terms of the actual distance (meters) using the raw GPS data.

Among these, stands out the Neural radiance fields (NeRF), which trains a deep network to map 5D input coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achieving an unprecedented level of photorealism on the generated images, NeRF is only applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried from different images. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allowing to reconstruct and render novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions. For this purpose we consider time as an additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main stages: one that encodes the scene into a canonical space and another that maps this canonical representation into the deformed scene at a particular time. Both mappings are learned using fully-connected networks. Once the networks are trained, D-NeRF can render novel images, controlling both the camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement.

Despite its importance, most existing RGB-T semantic segmentation models perform primitive fusion strategies, such as concatenation, element-wise summation and weighted summation, to fuse features from different modalities. These strategies, unfortunately, overlook the modality differences due to different imaging mechanisms, so that they suffer from the reduced discriminability of the fused features. To address such an issue, we propose, for the first time, the strategy of bridging-then-fusing, where the innovation lies in a novel Adaptive-weighted Bi-directional Modality Difference Reduction Network (ABMDRNet). Concretely, a Modality Difference Reduction and Fusion (MDRF) subnetwork is designed, which first employs a bi-directional image-to-image translation based method to reduce the modality differences between RGB features and thermal features, and then adaptively selects those discriminative multi-modality features for RGB-T semantic segmentation in a channel-wise weighted fusion way. Furthermore, considering the importance of contextual information in semantic segmentation, a Multi-Scale Spatial Context (MSC) module and a Multi-Scale Channel Context (MCC) module are proposed to exploit the interactions among multi-scale contextual information of cross-modality features together with their long-range dependencies along spatial and channel dimensions, respectively.

A key question for this forecast is: how to fully utilize the historical data (e.g., retinal image) up to the current stage for future disease prediction? In this paper, we provide an answer with a novel framework, namely Disease Forecast via Progression Learning (DFPL), which exploits the irreversibility prior (i.e., cannot be reversed once diagnosed). Specifically, based on this prior, we decompose two factors that contribute to the prediction of the future disease: i) the current disease label given the data (retinal image, clinical attributes) at present and ii) the future disease label given the progression of the retinal images that from the current to the future. To model these two factors, we introduce the current and progression predictors in DFPL, respectively. In order to account for the degree of progression of the disease, we propose a temporal generative model to accurately generate the future image and compare it with the current one to get a residual image.

In light of this, most existing methods for unsupervised domain adaptation focus on achieving domain-invariant representations and small source domain error. However, recent works have shown that this is not sufficient to guarantee good generalization on target domain and in fact is provably detrimental under label distribution shift. Furthermore, in many real-world applications it is often feasible to obtain a small amount of labeled data from the target domain and use them to facilitate model training with source data. Inspired by the above observations, in this paper we propose the first method that aims to simultaneously learn invariant representations and risks under the setting of semi-supervised domain adaptation (Semi-DA).

However, existing RefSR approaches fail to accomplish high-fidelity super-resolution under a large resolution gap, e.g., 8x upscaling, due to the lower consideration of the underlying scene structure. In this paper, we aim to solve the RefSR problem in actual multiscale camera systems inspired by multiplane image (MPI) representation. Specifically, we propose Cross-MPI, an end-to-end RefSR network composed of a novel plane-aware attention-based MPI mechanism, a multiscale guided upsampling module as well as a super-resolution (SR) synthesis and fusion module. Instead of using a direct and exhaustive matching between the cross-scale stereo, the proposed plane-aware attention mechanism fully utilizes the concealed scene structure for efficient attention-based correspondence searching. Further combined with a gentle coarse-to-fine guided upsampling strategy, the proposed Cross-MPI can achieve a robust and accurate detail transmission. Experimental results on both digitally synthesized and optical zoom cross-scale data show that the Cross-MPI framework can achieve superior performance against the existing RefSR methods and is a real fit for actual multiscale camera systems even with large-scale differences.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Zhou_Cross-MPI_Cross-Scale_Stereo_for_Image_Super-Resolution_Using_Multiplane_Images_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Our proposed approach is to initially densify sparse depth information by figuring out which plane a pixel should lie among a number of discretized depth planes, and then calculate the final depth value by predicting the distance from the specified plane. This will help the network to lessen the burden of directly regressing the absolute depth information from none, and to effectively obtain more accurate depth prediction result with less computation power and inference time. To do so, we firstly introduce a novel way of interpreting depth information with the closest depth plane label p and a residual value r, as we call it, Plane-Residual (PR) representation. We also propose a depth completion network utilizing PR representation consisting of a shared encoder and two decoders, where one classifies the pixel's depth plane label, while the other one regresses the normalized distance from the classified depth plane.

Such weighting scheme, however, largely depends on the prior understanding or subjective distribution assumption on HSI noises, making them easily biased to complicated real noises, and hardly generalizable to diverse practical scenarios. Against this issue, this paper proposes a new scheme aiming to capture general weighting principle in a data-driven manner. Specifically, such weighting principle is delivered by an explicit function, called hyperweight-net (HWnet), mapping from an input noisy image to its properly imposed weights. A Bayesian framework, as well as a variational inference algorithm, for inferring HWnet parameters is elaborately designed, expecting to extract the latent weighting rule for general diverse and complicated noisy HSIs. Comprehensive experiments substantiate that the learned HWnet can be not only finely generalized to different noise types from those used in training, but also effectively transferred to other weighted models for the issue.

Sewer pipes are manually inspected to determine whether the pipes are defective. However, this process is limited by the number of qualified inspectors and the time it takes to inspect a pipe. Automatization of this process is therefore of high interest. So far, the success of computer vision approaches for sewer defect classification has been limited when compared to the success in other fields mainly due to the lack of public datasets. To this end, in this work we present a large novel and publicly available multi-label classification dataset for image-based sewer defect classification called Sewer-ML. The Sewer-ML dataset consists of 1.3 million images annotated by professional sewer inspectors from three different utility companies across nine years.

For student morphism, weight inheritance strategy is adopted, allowing the student to flexibly update its architecture while fully utilize the predecessor's weights, which considerably accelerates the search; To facilitate dynamic distillation, an elastic teacher pool is trained via integrated progressive shrinking strategy, from which teacher detectors can be sampled without additional cost in subsequent searches.

Inspired by the back-tracing strategy in the conventional Hough voting methods, in this work, we introduce a new 3D object detection method, named as Back-tracing Representative Points Network (BRNet), which generatively back-traces the representative points from the vote centers and also revisits complementary seed points around these generated points, so as to better capture the fine local structural features surrounding the potential objects from the raw point clouds. Therefore, this bottom-up and then top-down strategy in our BRNet enforces mutual consistency between the predicted vote centers and the raw surface points and thus achieves more reliable and flexible object localization and class prediction results.

Departing from the recent literature which largely assumes the label noise rate is only determined by the true label class, the errors in human-annotated labels are more likely to be dependent on the difficulty levels of tasks, resulting in settings with instance-dependent label noise. We first provide evidences that the heterogeneous instance-dependent label noise is effectively down-weighting the examples with higher noise rates in a non-uniform way and thus causes imbalances, rendering the strategy of directly applying methods for class-dependent label noise questionable. Built on a recent work peer loss [24], we then propose and study the potentials of a second-order approach that leverages the estimation of several covariance terms defined between the instance-dependent noise rates and the Bayes optimal label. We show that this set of second-order statistics successfully captures the induced imbalances. We further proceed to show that with the help of the estimated second-order statistics, we identify a new loss function whose expected risk of a classifier under instance-dependent label noise is equivalent to a new problem with only class-dependent label noise. This fact allows us to apply existing solutions to handle this better-studied setting. We provide an efficient procedure to estimate these second-order statistics without accessing either ground truth labels or prior knowledge of the noise rates.

We examined domain variance and invariance property of FCs statistically and designed a network that can identify and fuse DIFs and DVFs dynamically through iterative learning.

On the basis of the fact that self-driving vehicles are equipped with various types of sensors (e.g., LiDAR scanner, RGB camera, radar, etc.), we propose a Cross-Modal Embedding framework that aims to benefit from the use of multiple input modalities. At training time, our model learns to embed a set of complementary features in a shared latent space by jointly optimizing the objective functions across different types of input data. At test time, a single input modality (e.g., LiDAR data) is required to generate predictions from the input perspective (i.e., in the LiDAR space), while taking advantages from the model trained with multiple sensor modalities.

Previous unpaired completion methods merely focus on the learning of geometric correspondence from incomplete shapes to complete shapes, and ignore the learning in the reverse direction, which makes them suffer from low completion accuracy due to the limited 3D shape understanding ability. To address this problem, we propose two simultaneous cycle transformations between the latent spaces of complete shapes and incomplete ones. Specifically, the first cycle transforms shapes from incomplete domain to complete domain, and then projects them back to the incomplete domain. This process learns the geometric characteristic of complete shapes, and maintains the shape consistency between the complete prediction and the incomplete input. Similarly, the inverse cycle transformation starts from complete domain to incomplete domain, and goes back to complete domain to learn the characteristic of incomplete shapes. We experimentally show that our model with the learned bidirectional geometry correspondence outperforms state-of-the-art unpaired completion methods.

Additionally, ProtoTree can locally explain a single prediction by outlining a decision path through the tree. Each node in our binary tree contains a trainable prototypical part. The presence or absence of this learned prototype in an image determines the routing through a node. Decision making is therefore similar to human reasoning: Does the bird have a red throat? And an elongated beak? Then it's a hummingbird! We tune the accuracy-interpretability trade-off using ensemble methods, pruning and binarizing. We apply pruning without sacrificing accuracy, resulting in a small tree with only 8 learned prototypes along a path to classify a bird from 200 species.

Addressing this problem, we first empirically analyze the roles of unseen-class samples with different degrees of hardness in the training process based on the uneven prediction phenomenon found in many ZSL methods, resulting in three observations. Then, we propose two hardness sampling approaches for selecting a subset of diverse and hard samples from a given unseen-class dataset according to these observations. The first one identifies the samples based on the class-level frequency of the model predictions while the second enhances the former by normalizing the class frequency via an approximate class prior estimated by an explored prior estimation algorithm.

Meeting both requirements challenges the state-of-the-art works which resort to either spatial attention or latent space factorization. Specifically, the former assume that each attribute has well-defined local support regions; they are often more effective for editing a local attribute than a global one. The latter factorize the latent space of a fixed pretrained GAN into different attribute-relevant parts, but they cannot be trained end-to-end with the GAN, leading to sub-optimal solutions. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel latent space factorization model, called L2M-GAN, which is learned end-to-end and effective for editing both local and global attributes. The key novel components are: (1) A latent space vector of the GAN is factorized into an attribute-relevant and irrelevant codes with an orthogonality constraint imposed to ensure disentanglement. (2) An attribute-relevant code transformer is learned to manipulate the attribute value; crucially, the transformed code are subject to the same orthogonality constraint. By forcing both the original attribute-relevant latent code and the edited code to be disentangled from any attribute-irrelevant code, our model strikes the perfect balance between attribute correctness and irrelevance preservation.

Only one label is provided at a time, and the model has to figure out the other label if it has already learned it. This setup is more aligned with real-life scenarios, where a learner usually interacts with the same family of entities multiple times, discovers more granularity about them, while still trying not to forget previous knowledge. Moreover, this setup enables evaluating models for some important lifelong learning challenges that cannot be easily addressed under the existing setups. These challenges can be motivated by the example ""if a model was trained on the class 'bear' in one task and on 'polar bear' in another task, will it forget the concept of 'bear', will it rightfully infer that a 'polar bear' is still a 'bear'? and will it wrongfully associate the label of 'polar bear' to other breeds of 'bear'?"".

Most recent Siamese-based trackers typically employ a depth-wise cross-correlation (DW-XCorr) to obtain multi-channel correlation information from the two feature maps (target and search region). However, DW-XCorr has several limitations within Siamese-based tracking: it can easily be fooled by distractors, has fewer activated channels, and provides weak discrimination of object boundaries. Further, DW-XCorr is a handcrafted parameter-free module and cannot fully benefit from offline learning on large-scale data. We propose a learnable module, called the asymmetric convolution (ACM), which learns to better capture the semantic correlation information in offline training on large-scale data. Different from DW-XCorr and its predecessor(XCorr), which regard a single feature map as the convolution kernel, our ACM decomposes the convolution operation on a concatenated feature map into two mathematically equivalent operations, thereby avoiding the need for the feature maps to be of the same size (width and height)during concatenation. Our ACM can incorporate useful prior information, such as bounding-box size, with standard visual features. Furthermore, ACM can easily be integrated into existing Siamese trackers based on DW-XCorror XCorr. To demonstrate its generalization ability, we integrate ACM into three representative trackers: SiamFC, SiamRPN++, and SiamBAN.

It underpinned many pre-deep seminal works on segmentation and detection, yet research has seen a rapid decline since the preferential shift to learning deep models. Of the limited attempts, most aimed at interpreting complex visual scenes using perceptual organizational rules. This has however been proven to be sub-optimal, since models were unable to effectively capture the visual complexity in real-world imagery. In this paper, we rejuvenate the study of perceptual organization, by advocating two positional changes: (i) we examine purposefully generated synthetic data, instead of complex real imagery, and (ii) we ask machines to synthesize novel perceptually-valid patterns, instead of explaining existing data. Our overall answer lies with the introduction of a novel visual challenge -- the challenge of perceptual question answering (PQA). Upon observing example perceptual question-answer pairs, the goal for PQA is to solve similar questions by generating answers entirely from scratch (see Figure 1). Our first contribution is therefore the first dataset of perceptual question-answer pairs, each generated specifically for a particular Gestalt principle. We then borrow insights from human psychology to design an agent that casts perceptual organization as a self-attention problem, where a proposed grid-to-grid mapping network directly generates answer patterns from scratch. Experiments show our agent to outperform a selection of naive and strong baselines.

To capture a novel species, we first fit the articulated template to each training sample. By disentangling pose and shape, we learn a shape space that captures variation both among species and within each species from image evidence. We learn models of multiple species from the CUB dataset, and contribute new species-specific and multi-species shape models that are useful for downstream reconstruction tasks. Using a low-dimensional embedding, we show that our learned 3D shape space better reflects the phylogenetic relationships among birds than learned perceptual features.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Wang_Birds_of_a_Feather_Capturing_Avian_Shape_Models_From_Images_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Learning Temporal Consistency for Low Light Video Enhancement From Single Images,"Fan Zhang, Yu Li, Shaodi You, Ying Fu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 4967-4976","Single image low light enhancement is an important task and it has many practical applications. Most existing methods adopt a single image approach. Although their performance is satisfying on a static single image, we found, however, they suffer serious temporal instability when handling low light videos. We notice the problem is because existing data-driven methods are trained from single image pairs where no temporal information is available. Unfortunately, training from real temporally consistent data is also problematic because it is impossible to collect pixel-wisely paired low and normal light videos under controlled environments in large scale and diversities with noise of identical statistics. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enforce the temporal stability in low light video enhancement with only static images. The key idea is to learn and infer motion field (optical flow) from a single image and synthesize short range video sequences. Our strategy is general and can extend to large scale datasets directly. Based on this idea, we propose our method which can infer motion prior for single image low light video enhancement and enforce temporal consistency. Rigorous experiments and user study demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our proposed method.

However, obtaining full sets of different modalities is limited by various factors, such as long acquisition times, high examination costs and artifact suppression. In addition, the complexity, high dimensionality and heterogeneity of neuroimaging data remains another key challenge in leveraging existing randomized scans effectively, as data of the same modality is often measured differently by different machines. There is a clear need to go beyond the traditional imaging-dependent process and synthesize anatomically specific target-modality data from a source input. In this paper, we propose to learn dedicated features that cross both intre- and intra-modal variations using a novel CSCl_4Net. Through an initial unification of intra-modal data in the feature maps and multivariate canonical adaptation, CSCl_4Net facilitates feature-level mutual transformation. The positive definite Riemannian manifold-penalized data fidelity term further enables CSCl_4Net to reconstruct missing measurements according to transformed features.

A key innovation is to represent the dynamics of the cloth geometry using a dynamical system that is controlled by the body states (shape and pose). This allows us to express the cloth motion as a resultant of external (skin friction and gravity) and internal (elasticity) forces. Inspired by the theory of optimal control, we optimize the body states such that the simulated cloth motion is matched to the point cloud measurements, and the analytic gradient of the simulator is back-propagated to update the body states. We propose a cloth relaxation scheme to initialize the cloth state, which ensures the physical validity.

The existing deep learning-based tracking algorithms use regular CNNs that are inherently translation equivariant, but not designed to tackle rotations. In this paper, we first demonstrate that in the presence of rotation instances in videos, the performance of existing trackers is severely affected. To circumvent the adverse effect of rotations, we present rotation-equivariant Siamese networks (RE-SiamNets), built through the use of group-equivariant convolutional layers comprising steerable filters. SiamNets allow estimating the change in orientation of the object in an unsupervised manner, thereby facilitating its use in relative 2D pose estimation as well. We further show that this change in orientation can be used to impose an additional motion constraint in Siamese tracking through imposing restriction on the change in orientation between two consecutive frames. For benchmarking, we present Rotation Tracking Benchmark (RTB), a dataset comprising a set of videos with rotation instances. Through experiments on two popular Siamese architectures, we show that RE-SiamNets handle the problem of rotation very well and outperform their regular counterparts.

We address this issue in our work and propose an instance affinity based criterion for source to target transfer during adaptation, called ILA-DA. We first propose a reliable and efficient method to extract similar and dissimilar samples across source and target, and utilize a multi-sample contrastive loss to drive the domain alignment process.

Data augmentations encourage models to learn desired invariances, such as invariance to horizontal flipping or small changes in color. Recent work has shown that arbitrary style transfer can be used as a form of data augmentation to encourage invariance to textures by creating painting-like images from photographs. However, a stylized photograph is not quite the same as an artist-created painting. Artists depict perceptually meaningful cues in paintings so that humans can recognize salient components in scenes, an emphasis which is not enforced in style transfer. Therefore, we study how style transfer and paintings differ in their impact on model robustness. First, we investigate the role of paintings as style images for stylization-based data augmentation. We find that style transfer functions well even without paintings as style images. Second, we show that learning from paintings as a form of perceptual data augmentation can improve model robustness. Finally, we investigate the invariances learned from stylization and from paintings, and show that models learn different invariances from these differing forms of data.

However, an implicit contradiction about reconstruction and classification is unfortunately ignored. On the one hand, to precisely reconstruct novel classes, the distributions of base classes should be close to those of novel classes (min-margin). On the other hand, to perform accurate classification, the distributions of either two classes must be far away from each other (max-margin). In this paper, we propose a class margin equilibrium (CME) approach, with the aim to optimize both feature space partition and novel class reconstruction in a systematic way. CME first converts the few-shot detection problem to the few-shot classification problem by using a fully connection layer to decouple localization features. CME then reserves adequate margin space for novel classes by introducing simple-yet-effective class margin loss during feature learning. Finally, CME pursues margin equilibrium by disturbing the features of novel class instances in an adversarial min-max fashion.

Specifically, we first define the instance FPR as the ratio between the number of the non-target similarities above a unified threshold and the total number of the non-target similarities. The unified threshold is estimated for a given total FPR. Then, we introduce an additional false positive penalty term into the softmaxbased losses to promote the consistency of instance FPRs.

The PLADE-Net is the first work that shows unprecedented accuracy levels, exceeding 95% in terms of the \delta^1 metric on the challenging KITTI dataset. Our PLADE-Net is based on a new network architecture with neural positional encoding and a novel loss function that borrows from the closed-form solution of the matting Laplacian to learn pixel-level accurate depth estimation from stereo images. Neural positional encoding allows our PLADE-Net to obtain more consistent depth estimates by letting the network reason about location-specific image properties such as lens and projection distortions. Our novel distilled matting Laplacian loss allows our network to predict sharp depths at object boundaries and more consistent depths in highly homogeneous regions. Our proposed method outperforms all previous self-supervised single-view depth estimation methods by a large margin on the challenging KITTI dataset, with unprecedented levels of accuracy. Furthermore, our PLADE-Net, naively extended for stereo inputs, outperforms the most recent self-supervised stereo methods, even without any advanced blocks like 1D correlations, 3D convolutions, or spatial pyramid pooling.

To mitigate the model reliance towards the background, we propose to remove the background impact by adding the background. That is, given a video, we randomly select a static frame and add it to every other frames to construct a distracting video sample. Then we force the model to pull the feature of the distracting video and the feature of the original video closer, so that the model is explicitly restricted to resist the background influence, focusing more on the motion changes.

In this paper, we show that effective feature-level collaboration of the networks for the three respective tasks could achieve much greater performance improvement for all three tasks than only loss-level joint optimization.

This assumption, however, is unrealistic for training fine-grained segmentation on large datasets since the annotation of fine-grained parts is extremely tedious. In this paper, we approach the problem with deep clustering, where the key idea is to learn part priors from a dataset with fine-grained segmentation but no part annotations. Given point sampled 3D shapes, we model the clustering priors of points with a similarity matrix and achieve part-based segmentation through minimizing a novel low rank loss. Further, since fine-grained parts can be very tiny, a 3D shape has to be densely sampled to ensure the tiny parts are well captured and segmented. To handle densely sampled point sets, we adopt a divide-and-conquer scheme. We first partition the large point set into a number of blocks. Each block is segmented using a deep-clustering-based part prior network (PriorNet) trained in a category-agnostic manner. We then train MergeNet, a graph convolution network, to merge the segments of all blocks to form the final segmentation result.

Some significant features for identification are embedded in unobvious body shape differences across pedestrians. To explore such body shape cues for cloth-changing Re-ID, we propose a Fine-grained Shape-Appearance Mutual learning framework (FSAM), a two-stream framework that learns fine-grained discriminative body shape knowledge in a shape stream and transfers it to an appearance stream to complement the cloth-unrelated knowledge in the appearance features. Specifically, in the shape stream, FSAM learns fine-grained discriminative mask with the guidance of identities and extracts fine-grained body shape features by a pose-specific multi-branch network. To complement cloth-unrelated shape knowledge in the appearance stream, dense interactive mutual learning is performed across low-level and high-level features to transfer knowledge from shape stream to appearance stream, which enables the appearance stream to be deployed independently without extra computation for mask estimation.

NLNL further employs a three-stage pipeline to improve convergence. As a result, filtering noisy data through the NLNL pipeline is cumbersome, increasing the training cost. In this study, we propose a novel improvement of NLNL, named Joint Negative and Positive Learning (JNPL), that unifies the filtering pipeline into a single stage.

In this work, we present the Feature-Aligned Person Search Network (AlignPS), the first anchor-free framework to efficiently tackle this challenging task. AlignPS explicitly addresses the major challenges, which we summarize as the misalignment issues in different levels (i.e., scale, region, and task), when accommodating an anchor-free detector for this task.

We investigate this important and under-explored problem, Automatic model Evaluation (AutoEval). Specifically, given a labeled training set and a classifier, we aim to estimate the classification accuracy on unlabeled test datasets. We construct a meta-dataset: a dataset comprised of datasets generated from the original images via various transformations such as rotation, background substitution, foreground scaling, etc. As the classification accuracy of the model on each sample (dataset) is known from the original dataset labels, our task can be solved via regression. Using the feature statistics to represent the distribution of a sample dataset, we can train regression models (e.g., a regression neural network) to predict model performance.

To well distinguish the actions, especially those with complicated spatio-temporal interactions, correctly locating the prominent motion areas is of crucial importance. However, most motion information in existing videos are difficult to label and training a model with good motion representations with supervision will thus require a large amount of human labour for annotation. In this paper, we address this problem by self-supervised learning. Specifically, we propose to learn Motion from Static Images (MoSI). The model learns to encode motion information by classifying pseudo motions generated by MoSI. We furthermore introduce a static mask in pseudo motions to create local motion patterns, which forces the model to additionally locate notable motion areas for the correct classification.We demonstrate that MoSI can discover regions with large motion even without fine-tuning on the downstream datasets. As a result, the learned motion representations boost the performance of tasks requiring understanding of complex scenes and motions, i.e., action recognition.

Two-stage NAS requires sampling from the search space during training, which directly impacts the accuracy of the final searched models. While uniform sampling has been widely used for its simplicity, it is agnostic of the model performance Pareto front, which is the main focus in the search process, and thus, misses opportunities to further improve the model accuracy.

Existing Ref-SR methods mostly rely on implicit correspondence matching to borrow HR textures from reference images to compensate for the information loss in input images. However, performing local transfer is difficult because of two gaps between input and reference images: the transformation gap (e.g. scale and rotation) and the resolution gap (e.g. HR and LR). To tackle these challenges, we propose C^ 2 -Matching in this work, which produces explicit robust matching crossing transformation and resolution. 1) For the transformation gap, we propose a contrastive correspondence network, which learns transformation-robust correspondences using augmented views of the input image. 2) For the resolution gap, we adopt a teacher-student correlation distillation, which distills knowledge from the easier HR-HR matching to guide the more ambiguous LR-HR matching. 3) Finally, we design a dynamic aggregation module to address the potential misalignment issue.

A common property among its various methods is that they only rely on the model's prediction to make labeling decisions without considering any prior knowledge about the visual similarity among the classes. In this paper, we demonstrate that this degrades the quality of pseudo-labeling as it poorly represents visually similar classes in the pool of pseudo-labeled data. We propose SemCo, a method which leverages label semantics and co-training to address this problem. We train two classifiers with two different views of the class labels: one classifier uses the one-hot view of the labels and disregards any potential similarity among the classes, while the other uses a distributed view of the labels and groups potentially similar classes together. We then co-train the two classifiers to learn based on their disagreements. We show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various SSL tasks including 5.6% accuracy improvement on Mini-ImageNet dataset with 1000 labeled examples. We also show that our method requires smaller batch size and fewer training iterations to reach its best performance.

A widely used strategy is to generate a complete point cloud from the incomplete one. However, the unordered nature of point clouds will degrade the generation of high-quality 3D shapes, as the detailed topology and structure of discrete points are hard to be captured by the generative process only using a latent code. In this paper, we address the above problem by reconsidering the completion task from a new perspective, where we formulate the prediction as a point cloud deformation process. Specifically, we design a novel neural network, named PMP-Net, to mimic the behavior of an earth mover. It moves move each point of the incomplete input to complete the point cloud, where the total distance of point moving paths (PMP) should be shortest. Therefore, PMP-Net predicts a unique point moving path for each point according to the constraint of total point moving distances. As a result, the network learns a strict and unique correspondence on point-level, and thus improves the quality of the predicted complete shape. We conduct comprehensive experiments on Completion3D and PCN datasets, which demonstrate our advantages over the state-of-the-art point cloud completion methods.

A new formulation is proposed under the assumption of an optimal student, where optimality is defined in the usual machine learning sense of empirical risk minimization. This is a sensible assumption for machine learning students and for human students in crowdsourcing platforms, who tend to perform at least as well as machine learning systems. It is shown that, if allowed unbounded effort, the optimal student always learns the optimal predictor for a classification task. Hence, the role of the optimal teacher is to select the teaching set that minimizes student effort. This is formulated as a problem of functional optimization where, at each teaching iteration, the teacher seeks to align the steepest descent directions of the risk of (1) the teaching set and (2) entire example population. The optimal teacher, denoted MaxGrad, is then shown to maximize the gradient of the risk on the set of new examples selected per iteration. MaxGrad teaching algorithms are finally provided for both binary and multiclass tasks, and shown to have some similarities with boosting algorithms. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of MaxGrad, which outperforms previous algorithms on the classification task, for both machine learning and human students from MTurk, by a substantial margin.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Wang_Gradient-Based_Algorithms_for_Machine_Teaching_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

Besides, the lack of real-world deraining datasets comprising different types of rain and their corresponding rain-free ground-truth also impedes deraining algorithm development. In this paper, we aim to address real-world deraining problems from two aspects. First, we propose a complementary cascaded network architecture, namely CCN, to remove rain streaks and raindrops in a unified framework. Specifically, our CCN removes raindrops and rain streaks in a complementary fashion, i.e., raindrop removal followed by rain streak removal and vice versa, and then fuses the results via an attention based fusion module. Considering significant shape and structure differences between rain streaks and raindrops, it is difficult to manually design a sophisticated network to remove them effectively. Thus, we employ neural architecture search to adaptively find optimal architectures within our specified deraining search space. Second, we present a new real-world rain dataset, namely RainDS, to prosper the development of deraining algorithms in practical scenarios. RainDS consists of rain images in different types and their corresponding rain-free ground-truth, including rain streak only, raindrop only, and both of them.

In the absence of additional information, first-order approximations, i.e. optical flow, must be used, but this choice restricts the types of motions that can be modeled, leading to errors in highly dynamic scenarios. Event cameras are novel sensors that address this limitation by providing auxiliary visual information in the blind-time between frames. They asynchronously measure per-pixel brightness changes and do this with high temporal resolution and low latency. Event-based frame interpolation methods typically adopt a synthesis-based approach, where predicted frame residuals are directly applied to the key-frames. However, while these approaches can capture non-linear motions they suffer from ghosting and perform poorly in low-texture regions with few events. Thus, synthesis-based and flow-based approaches are complementary. In this work, we introduce Time Lens, a novel method that leverages the advantages of both.

Then, we train a 3D convolutional neural network to produce discriminative anomaly-specific information by jointly learning multiple proxy tasks: three self-supervised and one based on knowledge distillation.

The challenges to learn such a representation are two-fold. Firstly, the sample size is not often large enough to learn a rich generalizable representation through conventional techniques. Secondly, while only normal samples are available at training, the learned features should be discriminative of normal and anomalous samples. Here, we propose to use the ""distillation"" of features at various layers of an expert network, which is pre-trained on ImageNet, into a simpler cloner network to tackle both issues. We detect and localize anomalies using the discrepancy between the expert and cloner networks' intermediate activation values given an input sample. We show that considering multiple intermediate hints in distillation leads to better exploitation of the expert's knowledge and a more distinctive discrepancy between the two networks, compared to utilizing only the last layer activation values. Notably, previous methods either fail in precise anomaly localization or need expensive region-based training. In contrast, with no need for any special or intensive training procedure, we incorporate interpretability algorithms in our novel framework to localize anomalous regions.

Different from existing methods, which often require ROI (Region of Interest) operations and/or grouping post-processing, FCPose eliminates the ROIs and grouping post-processing with dynamic instance-aware keypoint estimation heads. The dynamic keypoint heads are conditioned on each instance (person), and can encode the instance concept in the dynamically-generated weights of their filters. Moreover, with the strong representation capacity of dynamic convolutions, the keypoint heads in FCPose are designed to be very compact, resulting in fast inference and makes FCPose have almost constant inference time regardless of the number of persons in the image.

While this setting has been studied in the literature, here we show significantly stronger performance with a simple design (e.g., dramatically improving previous best reported mask AP of 21.1% to 31.6% on the COCO dataset). Our core idea is to redesign the loss of learning masks in instance segmentation, with no modification to the segmentation network itself. The new loss functions can supervise the mask training without relying on mask annotations. This is made possible with two loss terms, namely, 1) a surrogate term that minimizes the discrepancy between the projections of the ground-truth box and the predicted mask; 2) a pairwise loss that can exploit the prior that proximal pixels with similar colors are very likely to have the same category label. Experiments demonstrate that the redesigned mask loss can yield surprisingly high-quality instance masks with only box annotations. For example, without using any mask annotations, with a ResNet-101 backbone and 3x training schedule, we achieve 33.2% mask AP on COCO test-dev split (vs. 39.1% of the fully supervised counterpart).

Specifically, we take the key frames and motion vectors in compressed videos (e.g., in H.264 format) as the supervision sources for context and motion, respectively, which can be efficiently extracted at over 500 fps on CPU. Then we design two pretext tasks that are jointly optimized: a context matching task where a pairwise contrastive loss is cast between video clip and key frame features; and a motion prediction task where clip features, passed through an encoder-decoder network, are used to estimate motion features in a near future. These two tasks use a shared video backbone and separate MLP heads. Experiments show that our approach improves the quality of the learned video representation over previous works, where we obtain absolute gains of 16.0% and 11.1% in video retrieval recall on UCF101 and HMDB51, respectively. Moreover, we find the motion prediction to be a strong regularization for video networks, where using it as an auxiliary task improves the accuracy of action recognition with a margin of 7.4% 13.8%.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Huang_Self-Supervised_Video_Representation_Learning_by_Context_and_Motion_Decoupling_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

We propose to consider iterative point cloud registration as a reinforcement learning task and, to this end, present a novel registration agent (ReAgent).

We introduce a transductive inference for a given query image, leveraging the statistics of its unlabeled pixels, by optimizing a new loss containing three complementary terms: i) the cross-entropy on the labeled support pixels; ii) the Shannon entropy of the posteriors on the unlabeled query image pixels; and iii) a global KL-divergence regularizer based on the proportion of the predicted foreground. As our inference uses a simple linear classifier of the extracted features, its computational load is comparable to inductive inference and can be used on top of any base training.

These expert models are further improved by adding the regularization of making the consistent pixel-wise prediction for each sample with the same structured context. To obtain a single model that works across multiple target domains, we propose to simultaneously learn a student model which is trained to not only imitate the output of each expert on the corresponding target domain but also to pull different expert close to each other with regularization on their weights. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can effectively exploit rich structured information contained in both labeled source domain and multiple unlabeled target domains.

A formal statistical approach, termed geodesic regression model, is commonly used for modeling and analyzing relationships between Euclidean predictors and shape responses. Despite its popularity, this model faces several key challenges, including (i) misalignment of shapes due to pre-processing steps, (ii) difficulties in shape alignment due to imaging heterogeneity, and (iii) lack of spatial correlation in shape structures. This paper proposes a comprehensive geodesic factor regression model that addresses all these challenges. Instead of using shapes as extracted from pre-registered data, it takes a more fundamental approach, incorporating alignment step within the proposed regression model and learns them using both pre-shape and covariate data. Additionally, it specifies spatial correlation structures using low-dimensional representations, including latent factors on the tangent space and isotropic error terms. The proposed framework results in substantial improvements in regression performance, as demonstrated through simulation studies and a real data analysis on Corpus Callosum contour data obtained from the ADNI study.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Huang_Geo-FARM_Geodesic_Factor_Regression_Model_for_Misaligned_Pre-Shape_Responses_in_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr

A Functional Approach to Rotation Equivariant Non-Linearities for Tensor Field Networks.,"Adrien Poulenard, Leonidas J. Guibas"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 13174-13183","Learning pose invariant representation is a fundamental problem in shape analysis. Most existing deep learning algorithms for 3D shape analysis are not robust to rotations and are often trained on synthetic datasets consisting of pre-aligned shapes, yielding poor generalization to unseen poses. This observation motivates a growing interest in rotation invariant and equivariant methods. The field of rotation equivariant deep learning is developing in recent years thanks to a well established theory of Lie group representations and convolutions. A fundamental problem in equivariant deep learning is to design activation functions which are both informative and preserve equivariance. The recently introduced Tensor Field Network (TFN) framework provides a rotation equivariant network design for point cloud analysis. TFN features undergo a rotation in feature space given a rotation of the input pointcloud. TFN and similar designs consider nonlinearities which operate only over rotation invariant features such as the norm of equivariant features to preserve equivariance, making them unable to capture the directional information. In a recent work entitled ""Gauge Equivariant Mesh CNNs: Anisotropic Convolutions on Geometric Graphs"" Hann et al. interpret 2D rotation equivariant features as Fourier coefficients of functions on the circle. In this work we transpose the idea of Hann et al. to 3D by interpreting TFN features as spherical harmonics coefficients of functions on the sphere. We introduce a new equivariant nonlinearity and pooling for TFN. We show improvments over the original TFN design and other equivariant nonlinearities in classification and segmentation tasks.

Starting with a fully supervised model trained on the data with pixel-level masks, the proposed framework iteratively refines the model itself using the entire weakly labeled data (image-level soft label) in a self-training fashion. A novel sample selection strategy is proposed to identify those most informative samples for each iteration, based on the current model output and the soft labels of the weakly labeled data. A soft cross-entropy loss and a soft focal loss are also designed to serve as the image-level and pixel-level classification loss respectively.

Fast and Accurate Model Scaling,"Piotr Dollar, Mannat Singh, Ross Girshick"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 924-932","In this work we analyze strategies for convolutional neural network scaling; that is, the process of scaling a base convolutional network to endow it with greater computational complexity and consequently representational power. Example scaling strategies may include increasing model width, depth, resolution, etc. While various scaling strategies exist, their tradeoffs are not fully understood. Existing analysis typically focuses on the interplay of accuracy and flops (floating point operations). Yet, as we demonstrate, various scaling strategies affect model parameters, activations, and consequently actual runtime quite differently. In our experiments we show the surprising result that numerous scaling strategies yield networks with similar accuracy but with widely varying properties. This leads us to propose a simple fast compound scaling strategy that encourages primarily scaling model width, while scaling depth and resolution to a lesser extent. Unlike currently popular scaling strategies, which result in about O(s) increase in model activation w.r.t. scaling flops by a factor of s, the proposed fast compound scaling results in close to O(sqrt s ) increase in activations, while achieving excellent accuracy. Fewer activations leads to speedups on modern memory-bandwidth limited hardware (e.g., GPUs).

Linguistic Structures As Weak Supervision for Visual Scene Graph Generation,"Keren Ye, Adriana Kovashka"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 8289-8299","Prior work in scene graph generation requires categorical supervision at the level of triplets---subjects and objects, and predicates that relate them, either with or without bounding box information. However, scene graph generation is a holistic task: thus holistic, contextual supervision should intuitively improve performance. In this work, we explore how linguistic structures in captions can benefit scene graph generation.

Captions are a weaker type of supervision than triplets since the alignment between the exhaustive list of human-annotated subjects and objects in triplets, and the nouns in captions, is weak. However, given the large and diverse sources of multimodal data on the web (e.g. blog posts with images and captions), linguistic supervision is more scalable than crowdsourced triplets.

Our research aims at both fully connected and convolutional layers. For the fully connected layers, by utilizing the low-rank property of Kronecker factors of Fisher information matrix, our method only requires inverting a small matrix to approximate the curvature with desirable accuracy. For convolutional layers, we propose a way with two strategies to save computational efforts without affecting the empirical performance by reducing across the spatial dimension or receptive fields of feature maps. Specifically, we propose two effective dimension reduction methods for this purpose: Spatial Subsampling and Reduce Sum. Experimental results of training several deep neural networks on Cifar-10 and ImageNet-1k datasets demonstrate that SKFAC can capture the main curvature and yield comparative performance to K-FAC.

We design GPU-accelerated mesh decimation to facilitate network resolution reduction efficiently on-the-fly. Pooling and unpooling modules are defined on the vertex clusters gathered during decimation. For feature learning over meshes, Picasso contains three types of novel convolutions namely, facet2vertex, vertex2facet, and facet2facet convolution. Hence, it treats a mesh as a geometric structure comprising vertices and facets, rather than a spacial graph with edges as previous methods do. Picasso also incorporates a fuzzy mechanism in its filters for robustness to mesh sampling (vertex density). It exploits Gaussian mixtures to define fuzzy coefficients for the facet2vertex convolution, and barycentric interpolation to define the coefficients for the remaining two convolutions.

This is known as out-of-distribution (OoD) generalization problem. Recently, invariant risk minimization (IRM) attempts to tackle this issue by penalizing predictions based on the unstable spurious features in the data collected from different environments. However, similar to domain adaptation or domain generalization, a prevalent non-trivial limitation in these works is that the environment information is assigned by human specialists i.e. a priori or determined heuristically. However, an inappropriate group partitioning can dramatically deteriorate the OoD generalization and the process is expensive and time-consuming.

Experiments on various datasets and architectures demonstrate that the proposed method is able to be utilized for effectively learning portable student networks without the original data, e.g., with 0.16dB PSNR drop on Set5 for x2 super resolution.

PluckerNet: Learn To Register 3D Line Reconstructions,"Liu Liu, Hongdong Li, Haodong Yao, Ruyi Zha"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 1842-1852","Aligning two partially-overlapped 3D line reconstructions in Euclidean space is challenging, as we need to simultaneously solve line correspondences and relative pose between reconstructions. This paper proposes a neural network based method and it has three modules connected in sequence: (i) a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based network takes Pluecker representations of lines as inputs, to extract discriminative line-wise features and matchabilities (how likely each line is going to have a match), (ii) an Optimal Transport (OT) layer takes two-view line-wise features and matchabilities as inputs to estimate a 2D joint probability matrix, with each item describes the matchness of a line pair, and (iii) line pairs with Top-K matching probabilities are fed to a 2-line minimal solver in a RANSAC framework to estimate a six Degree-of-Freedom (6-DoF) rigid transformation. Experiments on both indoor and outdoor datasets show that registration (rotation and translation) precision of our method outperforms baselines significantly.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Liu_PluckerNet_Learn_To_Register_3D_Line_Reconstructions_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Deep Perceptual Preprocessing for Video Coding,"Aaron Chadha, Yiannis Andreopoulos"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 14852-14861","We introduce the concept of rate-aware deep perceptual preprocessing (DPP) for video encoding. DPP makes a single pass over each input frame in order to enhance its visual quality when the video is to be compressed with any codec at any bitrate. The resulting bitstreams can be decoded and displayed at the client side without any post-processing component. DPP comprises a convolutional neural network that is trained via a composite set of loss functions that incorporates: (i) a perceptual loss based on a trained no reference image quality assessment model, (ii) a reference based fidelity loss expressing L1 and structural similarity aspects, (iii) a motion-based rate loss via block-based transform, quantization and entropy estimates that converts the essential components of standard hybrid video encoder designs into a trainable framework. Extensive testing using multiple quality metrics and AVC, AV1 and VVC encoders shows that DPP+encoder reduces, on average, the bitrate of the corresponding encoder by 11%. This marks the first time a server-side neural processing component achieves such savings over the state-of-the-art in video coding.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Chadha_Deep_Perceptual_Preprocessing_for_Video_Coding_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
Explaining Classifiers Using Adversarial Perturbations on the Perceptual Ball,"Andrew Elliott, Stephen Law, Chris Russell"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 10693-10702","We present a simple regularization of adversarial perturbations based upon the perceptual loss. While the resulting perturbations remain imperceptible to the human eye, they differ from existing adversarial perturbations in that they are semi-sparse alterations that highlight objects and regions of interest while leaving the background unaltered. As a semantically meaningful adverse perturbations, it forms a bridge between counterfactual explanations and adversarial perturbations in the space of images. We evaluate our approach on several standard explainability benchmarks, namely, weak localization, insertion deletion, and the pointing game demonstrating that perceptually regularized counterfactuals are an effective explanation for image-based classifiers.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Elliott_Explaining_Classifiers_Using_Adversarial_Perturbations_on_the_Perceptual_Ball_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
DARCNN: Domain Adaptive Region-Based Convolutional Neural Network for Unsupervised Instance Segmentation in Biomedical Images,"Joy Hsu, Wah Chiu, Serena Yeung"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2021, pp. 1003-1012","In the biomedical domain, there is an abundance of dense, complex data where objects of interest may be challenging to detect or constrained by limits of human knowledge. Labelled domain specific datasets for supervised tasks are often expensive to obtain, and furthermore discovery of novel distinct objects may be desirable for unbiased scientific discovery. Therefore, we propose leveraging the wealth of annotations in benchmark computer vision datasets to conduct unsupervised instance segmentation for diverse biomedical datasets. The key obstacle is thus overcoming the large domain shift from common to biomedical images. We propose a Domain Adaptive Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (DARCNN), that adapts knowledge of object definition from COCO, a large labelled vision dataset, to multiple biomedical datasets. We introduce a domain separation module, a self-supervised representation consistency loss, and an augmented pseudo-labelling stage within DARCNN to effectively perform domain adaptation across such large domain shifts. We showcase DARCNN's performance for unsupervised instance segmentation on numerous biomedical datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2021/html/Hsu_DARCNN_Domain_Adaptive_Region-Based_Convolutional_Neural_Network_for_Unsupervised_Instance_CVPR_2021_paper.html,2021,cvpr
