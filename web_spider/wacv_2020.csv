Inferring Super-Resolution Depth from a Moving Light-Source Enhanced RGB-D Sensor: A Variational Approach,"Lu Sang, Bjoern Haefner, Daniel Cremers"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 1-10","A novel approach towards depth map super-resolution using multi-view uncalibrated photometric stereo is presented. Practically, an LED light source is attached to a commodity RGB-D sensor and is used to capture objects from multiple viewpoints with unknown motion. This non-static camera-to-object setup is described with a nonconvex variational approach such that no calibration on lighting or camera motion is require due to the formulation of an end-to-end joint optimization problem. Solving the proposed variational model results in high resolution depth, reflectance and camera estimates, as we show on challenging synthetic and real-world datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Sang_Inferring_Super-Resolution_Depth_from_a_Moving_Light-Source_Enhanced_RGB-D_Sensor_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
Unsupervised Learning of Camera Pose with Compositional Re-estimation,"Seyed shahabeddin Nabavi, Mehrdad Hosseinzadeh, Ramin Fahimi, Yang Wang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 11-20","We consider the problem of unsupervised camera pose estimation. Given an input video sequence, our goal is to estimate the camera pose (i.e. the camera motion) between consecutive frames. Traditionally, this problem is tackled by placing strict constraints on the transformation vector or by incorporating optical flow through a complex pipeline. We propose an alternative approach that utilizes a compositional re-estimation process for camera pose estimation. Given an input, we first estimate a depth map. Our method then iteratively estimates the camera motion based on the estimated depth map. Our approach significantly improves the predicted camera motion both quantitatively and visually. Furthermore, the re-estimation resolves the problem of out-of-boundaries pixels in a novel and simple way. Another advantage of our approach is that it is adaptable to other camera pose estimation approaches. Experimental analysis on KITTI benchmark dataset demonstrates that our method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches in unsupervised camera ego-motion estimation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Nabavi_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Camera_Pose_with_Compositional_Re-estimation_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
Blended Convolution and Synthesis for Efficient Discrimination of 3D Shapes,"Sameera Ramasinghe, Salman Khan, Nick Barnes, Stephen Gould"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 21-31","Existing models for shape analysis directly learn feature representations on 3D point clouds. We argue that 3D point clouds are highly redundant and hold irregular (permutation-invariant) structure, which makes it difficult to achieve inter-class discrimination efficiently. In this paper, we propose a two-pronged solution to this problem that is seamlessly integrated in a single blended convolution and synthesis layer. This fully differentiable layer performs two critical tasks in succession. In the first step, it projects the input 3D point clouds into a latent 3D space to synthesize a highly compact and inter-class discriminative point cloud representation. Since, 3D point clouds do not follow a Euclidean topology, standard 2/3D convolutional neural networks offer limited representation capability. Therefore, in the second step, we propose a novel 3D convolution operator functioning inside the unit ball to extract useful volumetric features. We derive formulae to achieve both translation and rotation of our novel convolution kernels. Finally, using the proposed techniques we present an extremely light-weight, end-to-end architecture that achieves compelling results on 3D shape recognition and retrieval.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Ramasinghe_Blended_Convolution_and_Synthesis_for_Efficient_Discrimination_of_3D_Shapes_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
A Multi-Scale Guided Cascade Hourglass Network for Depth Completion,"Ang Li, Zejian Yuan, Yonggen Ling, Wanchao Chi, shenghao zhang, Chong Zhang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 32-40","Depth completion, a task to estimate the dense depth map from sparse measurement under the guidance from the high-resolution image, is essential to many computer vision applications. Most previous methods building on fully convolutional networks can not handle diverse patterns in the depth map efficiently and effectively. We propose a multi-scale guided cascade hourglass network to tackle this problem. Structures at different levels are captured by specialized hourglasses in the cascade network with sparse inputs in various sizes. An encoder extracts multiscale features from color image to provide deep guidance for all the hourglasses. A multi-scale training strategy further activates the effect of cascade stages. With the role of each sub-module divided explicitly, we can implement components with simple architectures. Extensive experiments show that our lightweight model achieves competitive results compared with state-of-the-art in KITTI depth completion benchmark, with low complexity in run-time.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Li_A_Multi-Scale_Guided_Cascade_Hourglass_Network_for_Depth_Completion_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
Silhouette Guided Point Cloud Reconstruction beyond Occlusion,"Chuhang Zou, Derek Hoiem"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 41-50","One major challenge in 3D reconstruction is to infer the complete shape geometry from partial foreground occlusions. In this paper, we propose a method to reconstruct the complete 3D shape of an object from a single RGB image, with robustness to occlusion. Given the image and a silhouette of the visible region, our approach completes the silhouette of the occluded region and then generates a point cloud. We show improvements for reconstruction of non-occluded and partially occluded objects by providing the predicted complete silhouette as guidance. We also improve state-of-the-art for 3D shape prediction with a 2D reprojection loss from multiple synthetic views and a surface-based smoothing and refinement step.

Non-Rigid Structure from Motion: Prior-Free Factorization Method Revisited,Suryansh Kumar," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 51-60","A simple prior free factorization algorithm [??] is quite often cited work in the field of Non-Rigid Structure from Motion (NRSfM). The benefit of this work lies in its simplicity of implementation, strong theoretical justification to the motion and structure estimation, and its invincible originality. Despite this, the prevailing view is, that it performs exceedingly inferior to other methods on several benchmark datasets [??]. However, our subtle investigation provides some empirical statistics which made us think against such views. The statistical results we obtained supersedes Dai \it et al. [??] originally reported results on the benchmark datasets by a significant margin under some elementary changes in their core algorithmic idea [??]. Now, these results not only exposes some unrevealed areas for research in NRSfM but also give rise to new mathematical challenges for NRSfM researchers. We argue that by properly utilizing the well-established assumptions about a non-rigidly deforming shape i.e, it deforms smoothly over frames [??] and it spans a low-rank space, the simple prior-free idea can provide results which is comparable to the best available algorithms. In this paper, we explore some of the hidden intricacies missed by Dai \it et. al. work [??] and how some elementary measures and modifications can enhance its performance, as high as approx. 18% on the benchmark dataset. The improved performance is justified and empirically verified by extensive experiments on several datasets. We believe our work has both practical and theoretical importance for the development of better NRSfM algorithms.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Kumar_Non-Rigid_Structure_from_Motion_Prior-Free_Factorization_Method_Revisited_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
PointGrow: Autoregressively Learned Point Cloud Generation with Self-Attention,"Yongbin Sun, Yue Wang, Ziwei Liu, Joshua Siegel, Sanjay Sarma"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 61-70","Generating 3D point clouds is challenging yet highly desired. This work presents a novel autoregressive model, PointGrow, which can generate diverse and realistic point cloud samples from scratch or conditioned on semantic contexts. This model operates recurrently, with each point sampled according to a conditional distribution given its previously-generated points, allowing inter-point correlations to be well-exploited and 3D shape generative processes to be better interpreted. Since point cloud object shapes are typically encoded by long-range dependencies, we augment our model with dedicated self-attention modules to capture such relations. Extensive evaluations show that PointGrow achieves satisfying performance on both unconditional and conditional point cloud generation tasks, with respect to realism and diversity.

We propose a novel approach that builds upon the strengths of modern deep learning techniques and classical fitting algorithms and significantly improves performance. The proposed method replaces the final 1-by-1 convolutional layer employed in most depth completion networks with a least squares fitting module which computes weights by fitting the implicit depth bases to the given sparse depth measurements. In addition, we show how our proposed method can be naturally extended to a multi-scale formulation for improved self-supervised training.

High Accuracy Face Geometry Capture using a Smartphone Video,"Shubham Agrawal, Anuj Pahuja, Simon Lucey"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 81-90","What's the most accurate 3D model of your face you can obtain while sitting at your desk? We attempt to answer this question in our work. High fidelity face reconstructions have so far been limited to either studio settings or through expensive 3D scanners. On the other hand, unconstrained reconstruction methods are typically limited by low-capacity models. Our method reconstructs accurate face geometry of a subject using a video shot from a smartphone in an unconstrained environment. Our approach takes advantage of recent advances in visual SLAM, keypoint detection, and object detection to improve accuracy and robustness. By not being constrained to a model subspace, our reconstructed meshes capture important details while being robust to noise and being topologically consistent. Our evaluations show that our method outperforms current single and multi-view baselines by a significant margin, both in terms of geometric accuracy and in capturing person-specific details important for making realistic looking models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Agrawal_High_Accuracy_Face_Geometry_Capture_using_a_Smartphone_Video_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

Inspired by classical methods, FlowNet3D++ incorporates geometric constraints in the form of point-toplane distance and angular alignment between individual vectors in the flow field, into FlowNet3D. We demonstrate that the addition of these geometric loss terms improves the previous state-of-art FlowNet3D accuracy from 57.85% to 63.43%. To further demonstrate the effectiveness of our geometric constraints, we propose a benchmark for flow estimation on the task of dynamic 3D reconstruction, thus providing a more holistic and practical measure of performance than the breakdown of individual metrics previously used to evaluate scene flow. This is made possible through the contribution of a novel pipeline to integrate point-based scene flow predictions into a global dense volume. FlowNet3D++ achieves up to a 15.0% reduction in reconstruction error over FlowNet3D, and up to a 35.2% improvement over KillingFusion alone.

Style Transfer for Light Field Photography,"David Hart, Bryan Morse, Jessica Greenland"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 99-108","As light field images continue to increase in use and application, it becomes necessary to adapt existing image processing methods to this unique form of photography. In this paper we explore methods for applying neural style transfer to light field images. Feed-forward style transfer networks provide fast, high-quality results for monocular images, but no such networks exist for full light field images. Because of the size of these images, current light field data sets are small and are insufficient for training purely feed-forward style-transfer networks from scratch. Thus, it is necessary to adapt existing monocular style transfer networks in a way that allows for the stylization of each view of the light field while maintaining visual consistencies between views. To do this, we first generate disparity maps for each view given a single depth image for the light field. Then in a fashion similar to neural stylization of stereo images, we use disparity maps to enforce a consistency loss between views and to warp feature maps during the feed forward stylization. Unlike previous work, however, light fields have too many views to train a purely feed-forward network that can stylize the entire light field with angular consistency. Instead, the proposed method uses an iterative optimization for each view of a single light field image that backpropagates the consistency loss through the network. Thus, the network architecture allows for the incorporation of pre-trained fast monocular stylization network while avoiding the need for a large light field training set.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Hart_Style_Transfer_for_Light_Field_Photography_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
Fourier Based Pre-Processing For Seeing Through Water,"Jerin Geo James, Ajit Rajwade"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 109-117","Consider a scene submerged underneath a fluctuating water surface. Images of such a scene, when acquired from a camera in the air, exhibit significant spatial distortions. In this paper, we present a novel, computationally efficient pre-processing algorithm to correct a significant amount (~ 50%) of apparent distortion present in video sequences of such a scene. We demonstrate that when the partially restored video output from this stage is given as input to other methods, it significantly improves their performance. This algorithm involves (i) tracking a small number N of salient feature points across the T frames to yield point-trajectories \ \boldsymbol q_i \triangleq \ (x_ it ,y_ it )\ _ t=1 ^T\ _ i=1 ^N, and (ii) using the point-trajectories to infer the deformations at other non-tracked points in every frame. A Fourier decomposition of the N trajectories, followed by a novel Fourier phase-interpolation step, is used to infer deformations at all other points. Our method exploits the inherent spatio-temporal characteristics of the fluctuating water surface to correct non-rigid deformations to a very large extent.

DeOccNet: Learning to See Through Foreground Occlusions in Light Fields,"Yingqian Wang, Tianhao Wu, Jungang Yang, Longguang Wang, Wei An, Yulan Guo"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 118-127","Background objects occluded in some views of a light field (LF) camera can be seen by other views. Consequently, occluded surfaces are possible to be reconstructed from LF images. In this paper, we handle the LF de-occlusion (LF-DeOcc) problem using a deep encoder-decoder network (namely, DeOccNet). In our method, sub-aperture images (SAIs) are first given to the encoder to incorporate both spatial and angular information. The encoded representations are then used by the decoder to render an occlusion-free center-view SAI. To the best of our knowledge, DeOccNet is the first deep learning-based LF-DeOcc method. To handle the insufficiency of training data, we propose an LF synthesis approach to embed selected occlusion masks into existing LF images. Besides, several synthetic and real-world LFs are developed for performance evaluation. Experimental results show that, after training on the generated data, our DeOccNet can effectively remove foreground occlusions and achieves superior performance as compared to other state-of-the-art methods.

Appearance and Shape from Water Reflection,"Ryo Kawahara, Meng-Yu Kuo, Shohei Nobuhara, Ko Nishino"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 128-136","This paper introduces single-image geometric and appearance reconstruction from water reflection photography, i.e., images capturing direct and water-reflected real-world scenes. Water reflection offers an additional viewpoint to the direct sight, collectively forming a stereo pair. The water-reflected scene, however, includes internally scattered and reflected environmental illumination in addition to the scene radiance, which precludes direct stereo matching. We derive a principled iterative method that disentangles this scene radiometry and geometry for reconstructing 3D scene structure as well as its high-dynamic range appearance. In the presence of waves, we simultaneously recover the wave geometry as surface normal perturbations of the water surface. Most important, we show that the water reflection enables calibration of the camera. In other words, for the first time, we show that capturing a direct and water-reflected scene in a single exposure forms a self-calibrating HDR catadioptric stereo camera. We demonstrate our method on a number of images taken in the wild.

An Extended Exposure Fusion and its Application to Single Image Contrast Enhancement,"Charles Hessel, Jean-Michel Morel"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 137-146","Exposure Fusion is a high dynamic range imaging technique fusing a bracketed exposure sequence into a high quality image. In this paper, we provide a refined version resolving its out-of-range artifact and its low-frequency halo. It improves on the original Exposure Fusion by augmenting contrast in all image parts. Furthermore, we extend this algorithm to single exposure images, thereby turning it into a competitive contrast enhancement operator.

Online Lens Motion Smoothing for Video Autofocus,"Abdullah Abuolaim, Michael Brown"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 147-155","Autofocus (AF) is the process of moving the camera's lens such that desired scene content is in focus. AF for single image capture is a well-studied research topic and most modern cameras have hardware support that allows quick lens movements to optimize image sharpness. How to best perform AF for video is less clear. Conventional wisdom would suggest that each temporal frame should be as sharp as possible. However, unlike single image capture, the effects of the lens movement is visible in the captured video. As a result, there are two parameters to consider in AF for video: sharpness and lens movement. In this paper, we show that users preferred videos with smooth lens movement, even if it results in less overall sharpness. Based on this observation, we propose two novel AF algorithms for video that strive for both smooth lens movement and sharp scene content. Specifically, we introduce (1) a bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM) module trained on smooth lens trajectories and (2) a simple weighted moving average (WMA) method that factors in prior lens motion. Both of these methods have demonstrated excellent results in terms of reducing lens movements (up to 64% reduction) without greatly affecting the sharpness (less than 5.2% change in sharpness). Moreover, videos produced using our methods are more preferred by users over conventional AF that aims only for maximizing sharpness.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Abuolaim_Online_Lens_Motion_Smoothing_for_Video_Autofocus_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

Self-Guided Novel View Synthesis via Elastic Displacement Network,"Yicun Liu, Jiawei Zhang, Ye Ma, Jimmy Ren"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 164-173","Synthesizing a novel view from different viewpoints has been an essential problem in 3D vision. Among a variety of view synthesis tasks, single image based view synthesis is particularly challenging. Recent works address this problem by a fixed number of image planes of discrete disparities, which tend to generate structurally inconsistent results on wide-baseline, scene-complicated datasets such as KITTI. In this paper, we propose the Self-Guided Elastic Displacement Network (SG-EDN), which explicitly models the geometric transformation by a novel non-discrete scene representation called layered displacement maps (LDM). To generate realistic views, we exploit the positional characteristics of the displacement maps and design a multi-scale structural pyramid for self-guided filtering on the displacement maps. To optimize efficiency and scene-adaptivity, we allow the effective range of each displacement map to be elastic, with fully learnable parameters.

Fast Deep Stereo with 2D Convolutional Processing of Cost Signatures,"Kyle Yee, Ayan Chakrabarti"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 183-191","Modern neural network-based algorithms are able to produce highly accurate depth estimates from stereo image pairs, nearly matching the reliability of measurements from more expensive depth sensors. However, this accuracy comes with a higher computational cost since these methods use network architectures designed to compute and process matching scores across all candidate matches at all locations, with floating point computations repeated across a match volume with dimensions corresponding to both space and disparity. This leads to longer running times to process each image pair, making them impractical for real-time use in robots and autonomous vehicles. We propose a new stereo algorithm that employs a significantly more efficient network architecture. Our method builds an initial match cost volume using traditional matching costs that are fast to compute, and trains a network to estimate disparity from this volume. Crucially, our network only employs per-pixel and two-dimensional convolution operations: to summarize the local match information at each location as a low-dimensional feature vector, and to spatially process these ""cost-signature"" features to produce a dense disparity map.

Reference Grid-assisted Network for 3D Point Signature Learning from Point Clouds,"Jing Zhu, Yi Fang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 211-220","Learning a robust 3D point signature from point clouds is an interesting but challenging task in the computer vision field due to the irregular and unordered structure characteristics of the point cloud data. In this paper, we propose to learn a 3D point signature by exploring the implicit relation between keypoints and their neighbors (grouped as patches) among the given scene point clouds. Specially, we design a uniform reference grid to represent the raw relation between each keypoint and its neighbors from the raw point clouds. In order to learn a 3D point signature gradually from a smaller perceptive region to a larger area, we create a novel framework with a MLP-based unit feature network and a 3D CNN-based grid feature network. Specifically, the unit feature network aims to dig the connections from points fallen into the same unit of the reference grid, while the grid feature network is used to discover the grid-wise relations across the whole reference grid with concatenation of the learned unit-wise features. Moreover, we introduce an MLP-based attention network upon the unit feature network to enhance the discriminative ability of our learned 3D point signature. All the components in our proposed model are implemented as siamese ones to better tackle the classic keypoint matching and geometric registration problems. Our proposed 3D point signature learning approach achieves superior performance over other state-of-the-art methods on keypoint matching and geometric registration on the real-world scenes datasets, e.g. SUN3D, 7-scenes and the synthetic scan augmented scenes in ICL-NUIM dataset.

While classical calibration relies on tools like checkerboards or additional scene information, auto-calibration only takes epipolar relations into account. Classical calibration is often impractical, tends to de-adjust over time and distributes the error over the entire, limited working volume. Auto-calibration, on the other hand, does not require any information other than the image content itself, has a virtually unlimited working range and usually achieves highest accuracy at the objects' surfaces. Unfortunately, auto-calibration methods are sensitive to errors in the fundamental matrix and need good initialization to converge to the global solution. In practice this leads to difficulties if optical parameters like principal point or focal length are unconstrained. In such situations, even state-of-the-art auto-calibration methods tend to diverge and do not yield a valid calibration. This work assesses reasons for this behavior, in particular for the initialization method of Bougnoux [3] and Lourakis' state-of-the-art auto-calibration method [21]. Based on the analysis, a more stable method is proposed. A continuous and smooth energy functional is introduced, providing superior convergence properties. I.e. it can not diverge, converges faster, and has a significantly enlarged convergence region with respect to the global minimum. Finally, a thorough evaluation has been conducted and a detailed comparison with the state of the art is presented.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Fetzer_Stable_Intrinsic_Auto-Calibration_from_Fundamental_Matrices_of_Devices_with_Uncorrelated_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
Deep Image Blending,"Lingzhi Zhang, Tarmily Wen, Jianbo Shi"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 231-240","Image composition is an important operation to create visual content. Among image composition tasks, image blending aims to seamlessly blend an object from a source image onto a target image with lightly mask adjustment. A popular approach is Poisson image blending, which enforces the gradient domain smoothness in the composite image. However, this approach only considers the boundary pixels of target image, and thus can not adapt to texture of target image. In addition, the colors of the target image often seep through the original source object too much causing a significant loss of content of the source object. We propose a Poisson blending loss that achieves the same purpose of Poisson image blending. In addition, we jointly optimize the proposed Poisson blending loss as well as the style and content loss computed from a deep network, and reconstruct the blending region by iteratively updating the pixels using the L-BFGS solver. In the blending image, we not only smooth out gradient domain of the blending boundary but also add consistent texture into the blending region. User studies show that our method can outperform strong baselines as well as state-of-the-art approaches when placing objects onto both paintings and real-world images.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Zhang_Deep_Image_Blending_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
Cross-Domain Face Synthesis using a Controllable GAN,"Fania Mokhayeri, Kaveh Kamali, Eric Granger"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 252-260","The performance of face recognition (FR) systems for video surveillance has been shown to improve when the design data is augmented through synthetic face generation. This is true, for instance, with pair-wise matchers (e.g., deep Siamese networks) that rely on a reference gallery, typically with one still image per individual. However, generating synthetic images based on stills may not improve performance during operations due to the domain shift w.r.t. the target domain. Moreover, despite the emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for realistic synthetic generation, it is often difficult to control the conditions under which synthetic faces are generated. In this paper, a cross-domain face synthesis approach is proposed that integrates a new Controllable GAN (C-GAN). It employs an off-the-shelf 3D face model as a simulator to generate facial images under various poses. The simulated images and noise are input to the C-GAN for realism refinement. It relies on an additional adversarial game as a third player to preserve the identity and specific facial attributes of the refined images. This allows generating realistic synthetic face images that reflect capture conditions in the target domain, while controlling the GAN output such that faces may be generated under desired pose conditions. Experiments were performed using videos from the Chokepoint and COX-S2V datasets, and a deep Siamese network for FR with a single reference still per person. Results indicate that the proposed approach can provide a higher level of accuracy compared to state-of-the-art approaches for synthetic data augmentation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Mokhayeri_Cross-Domain_Face_Synthesis_using_a_Controllable_GAN_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

But most previous studies were before the wave of deep learning matchers, and most considered accuracy only in terms of the verification rate for genuine pairs. This paper investigates accuracy for age groups 16-29, 30-49 and 50-70, using three modern deep CNN matchers, and considers differences in the impostor and genuine distributions as well as verification rates and ROC curves. We find thataccuracy is lower for older persons and higher for younger persons. In contrast, a pre deep learning matcher on the same dataset shows the traditional result of higher accuracy for older persons, although its overall accuracy is much lower than that of the deep learning matchers. Comparing the impostor and genuine distributions, we conclude that impostor scores have a larger effect than genuine scores in causing lower accuracy for the older age group. We also investigate the effects of training data across the age groups. Our results show that fine-tuning the deep CNN models on additional images of older persons actually lowers accuracy for the older age group. Also, we fine-tune and train from scratch two models using age-balanced training datasets, and these results also show lower accuracy for older age group.

Offset Calibration for Appearance-Based Gaze Estimation via Gaze Decomposition,"Zhaokang Chen, Bertram Shi"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 270-279","Appearance-based gaze estimation provides relatively unconstrained gaze tracking. However, subject-independent models achieve limited accuracy partly due to individual variations. To improve estimation, we propose a gaze decomposition method that enables low complexity calibration, i.e., using calibration data collected when subjects view only one or a few gaze targets and the number of images per gaze target is small. Lowering the complexity of calibration makes it more convenient and less time-consuming for the user, and more widely applicable. Motivated by our finding that the inter-subject squared bias exceeds the intra-subject variance for a subject-independent estimator, we decompose the gaze estimate into the sum of a subject-independent term estimated from the input image by a deep convolutional network and a subject-dependent bias term. During training, both the weights of the deep network and the bias terms are estimated. During testing, if no calibration data is available, we can set the bias term to zero. Otherwise, the bias term can be estimated from images of the subject gazing at known gaze targets. Experimental results on three datasets show that without calibration, our method outperforms state-of-the-art by at least 6.3%. For low complexity calibration sets, our method outperforms other calibration methods. More complex calibration algorithms do not outperform our method until the size of the calibration set is excessively large. Even then, the gains obtained by alternatives are small, e.g., only 0.1 degree lower error for 64 gaze targets.

The face morphing attack thus raises a severe concern to various security applications like border control and e-passport unless such attacks are detected and mitigated. In this work, we propose a novel method to reliably detect the morphed face attacks using a new denoising framework.

To accomplish this goal using a vision-based automated approach, multiple tasks such as pose estimation, object segmentation and gaze estimation must be addressed. Gaze direction provides some of the strongest indications of how a person interacts with the environment. In this paper, we propose a simple neural network regressor that estimates the gaze direction of individuals in a multi-camera assisted living scenario, relying only on the relative positions of facial keypoints collected from a single pose estimation model. To handle cases of keypoint occlusion, our model exploits a novel confidence gated unit in its input layer. In addition to the gaze direction, our model also outputs an estimation of its own prediction uncertainty. Experimental results on a public benchmark demonstrate that our approach performs on par with a complex, dataset-specific baseline, while its uncertainty predictions are highly correlated to the actual angular error of corresponding estimations.

Data assimilation and machine learning are complementary methods: the former allows us to make use of information about the underlying dynamics of a system but lacks the flexibility of a data-based model, which we can instead obtain with the latter. Our framework presents a real-time tracking module for any single or multi-person pose estimation system. Specifically, tracking is performed by a number of Kalman filters initiated for each new person appearing in a motion sequence. This permits tracking of multiple skeletons and reduces the frequency that computationally expensive pose estimation has to be run, enabling online pose tracking. The module tracks for N frames while the pose estimates are calculated for frame (N+1).

As opposed to generative models, predicting directly in the feature space is easier and avoid incertitude problems for long-term predictions. Today, using CPC to learn representations for videos remains challenging due to the structure and the high dimensionality of the signal. We demonstrate experimentally that the representations learned by the network are useful for action recognition. We test it with different input types such as optical flows, image differences and raw images on different datasets (UCF-101 and HMDB51). It gives consistent results across the modalities.

Fine-Grained Motion Representation For Template-Free Visual Tracking,"Kai Shuang, Yuheng Huang, Yue Sun, Zhun Cai, Hao Guo"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 671-680","The object tracking task requires tracking the arbitrary target in consecutive video frames. Recently, several attempts have been made to develop the template-free models to attain generality. However, the current template-free paradigm only estimates the displacement to approximate the motion of the object. The displacement is insufficient to represent complex bounding box transformation, including scaling and rotation. We argue that the coarse-grained representation of object motion limits the performance of current template-free approaches. In this paper, we explore the finer-grained motion estimation to improve the accuracy of the template-free model. In respect of the image space, our method estimates the transformation for each pixel in the image. Concern on the motion representation, we represent the motion by the transformation parameterized by displacement, scaling, and rotation. By applying the differential vector operators on the optical flow, our approach estimates both displacement, scaling, and rotation for each pixel in a unified theory. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first work to model the displacement, scaling, and rotation in a unified theory with the optical flow. To further improve the localization accuracy, we develop the appearance branch to introduce the appearance information into our model. Furthermore, to suppress optical flow estimation failure samples during training, we propose a novel loss function Limited L1.

Towards solving this task, we introduce the Citywalks dataset, which consists of over 200k high-resolution video frames. Citywalks comprises of footage recorded in 21 cities from 10 European countries in a variety of weather conditions and over 3.5k unique pedestrian trajectories.

This warping imparts upon the system the property that projected features will fall on distinct conjugate epipolar lines of the rectified projector and acquired camera images. This reduces the correspondence search to a trivial constant-time table lookup once a feature is found in the camera image, and leads to robust, accurate, and extremely efficient disparity calculations.

To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an adversarial training method to generalize the detector by introducing perturbation with specific noise property of sonar images during training stage. We design a sideway network which we name Noise Adversarial Network (NAN). The NAN is embedded into the state-of-the-art detector to generate adversarial examples which serve as assistant decision-making items to predict both class and bounding box, aiming to improve the generalization and noise robustness of the detector. To provide prior knowledge of noise perturbation to NAN, we also design a Noise Block (NB) for introducing noise in the upstream layers, which further improves noise robustness.

Specifically, our importance weight promotes unlabeled samples with large uncertainty in classification and diversity compared to labeled examples, thus serving as a sample selection scheme for active learning. We show that these two views can be unified in one framework for domain adaptation and transfer learning when the source domain has many labeled examples while the target domain does not.

To address this issue, we propose a novel method named Cycle-consistent Adversarial Networks for Zero-Shot Learning (CANZSL). It encourages a visual feature generator to synthesize realistic visual features from semantics, and then inversely translate back the synthesized visual features to the corresponding semantic space by a semantic feature generator. Furthermore, in this paper a more challenging and practical ZSL problem is considered where the original semantics are from natural language with irrelevant words instead of clean semantics, which are widely used in previous work. Specifically, a multi-modal consistent bidirectional generative adversarial model is trained to handle unseen instances by suppressing noise in the natural language. A forward one-to-many mapping from the class level descriptions to the visual features is coupled with an inverse many-to-one mapping from the visual space to the semantic space. Thus, a multi-modal cycle-consistency loss between the synthesized semantic representations and the ground truth can be learned and leveraged to enforce the generated semantic features to approximate to the real distribution in semantic space.

The convolutional filters used in CNNs have played a major role in this success, by extracting useful features from the inputs. Recently researchers have tried to boost the performance of CNNs by re-calibrating the feature maps produced by these filters, e.g., Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENets). These approaches have achieved better performance by Exciting up the important channels or feature maps while diminishing the rest. However, in the process, architectural complexity has increased. We propose an architectural block that introduces much lower complexity than the existing methods of CNN performance boosting while performing significantly better than them. We carry out experiments on the CIFAR, ImageNet and MS-COCO datasets, and show that the proposed block can challenge the state-of-the-art results. Our method boosts the ResNet-50 architecture to perform comparably to the ResNet-152 architecture, which is a three times deeper network, on classification.

Generating Positive Bounding Boxes for Balanced Training of Object Detectors,"Kemal Oksuz, Baris Can Cam, Emre Akbas, Sinan Kalkan"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 894-903","Two-stage deep object detectors generate a set of regions-of-interest (RoIs) in the first stage, then, in the second stage, identify objects among the proposed RoIs that sufficiently overlap with a ground truth (GT) box. The second stage is known to suffer from a bias towards RoIs that have low intersection-over-union (IoU) with the associated GT boxes. To address this issue, we first propose a sampling method to generate bounding boxes (BB) that overlap with a given reference box more than a given IoU threshold. Then, we use this BB generation method to develop a positive RoI (pRoI) generator that, for the second stage, produces RoIs following any desired spatial or IoU distribution. We show that our pRoI generator is able to simulate other sampling methods for positive examples such as hard example mining and prime sampling. Using our generator as an analysis tool, we show that (i) IoU imbalance has an adverse effect on performance, (ii) hard positive example mining improves the performance only for certain input IoU distributions, and (iii) the imbalance among the foreground classes has an adverse effect on performance and that it can be alleviated at the batch level. Finally, we train Faster R-CNN using our pRoI generator and, compared to conventional training, obtain better or on-par performance for low IoUs and significant improvements when trained for higher IoUs for Pascal VOC and MS COCO datasets.

Is pruning a compression or evolution process? Does pruning only work on trained neural networks? What is the role and value of the uncovered sparsity structure? In this paper, we strive to answer these questions by analyzing three unstructured pruning methods (magnitude based pruning, post-pruning re-initialization, and random sparse initialization). We conduct extensive experiments using the Singular Vector Canonical Correlation Analysis (SVCCA) tool to study and contrast layer representations of pruned and original ResNet, VGG, and ConvNet models.

Increasing the non-linearity in the network will enhance the network's learning capability, attributing to better performance. We present a novel Wide Hidden Expansion (WHE) layer that can significantly increase (by an order of magnitude ) the number of activation functions in the network, with very little increase of computational complexity and memory consumption. It can be flexibly embedded with different network architectures to boost the performance of the original networks. The WHE layer is composed of a wide hidden layer, in which each channel only connects with two input channels and one output channel. Before connecting to the output channel, each intermediate channel in the WHE layer is followed by one activation function. In this manner, the number of activation functions can grow along with the number of channels in the hidden layer. We apply the WHE layer to ResNet, WideResNet, SENet, and MobileNet architectures and evaluate on ImageNet, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet dataset. On the ImageNet dataset, models with the WHE layer can achieve up to 2.01% higher Top-1 accuracy than baseline models, with less than 4% computation increase and less than 2% more parameters.

Observing the phenomenon that human visual system (HVS) relies heavily on the temporal dependencies among frames from the visual input to conduct recognition efficiently, we propose a novel framework dubbed as TKD: temporal knowledge distillation. This framework distills the temporal knowledge from a heavy neural network-based model over selected video frames (the perception of the moments) to a light-weight model. To enable the distillation, we put forward two novel procedures: 1) a Long-short Term Memory (LSTM)-based key frame selection method; and 2) a novel teacher-bounded loss design.

In this work we focus on their ability to have invariance towards the presence or absence of details. For example, humans are able to watch cartoons, which are missing many visual details, without being explicitly trained to do so. As another example, 3D rendering software is a relatively recent development, yet people are able to understand such rendered scenes even though they are missing details (consider a film like Toy Story). This capability goes beyond visual data: humans are easily able to recognize isolated melodies from musical pieces when heard for the first time, even if the only piece they've listened to previously is from an orchestra. Thus the failure of machine learning algorithms to do this indicates a significant gap in generalization between human abilities and the abilities of deep networks. We propose a dataset that will make it easier to study the detail-invariance problem concretely. We produce a concrete task for this: SketchTransfer, and we show that state-of-the-art domain transfer algorithms still struggle with this task. The state-of-the-art technique which achieves over 95% on MNIST \xrightarrow SVHN transfer only achieves 59% accuracy on the SketchTransfer task, which is much better than random (11% accuracy) but falls short of the 87% accuracy of a classifier trained directly on labeled sketches.

Currently, radars and lidars are pri- marily used for this purpose which are either expensive or offer poor resolution. Deep learning based depth or dis- tance estimation techniques require huge amount of data and ensuring domain invariance is a challenge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a single view geometric approach which is lightweight and uses geometric features of the road lane markings for distance estimation that integrates well with the lane and vehicle detection modules of an existing ADAS. Our system introduces novelty on two fronts: (1) it uses cross-ratios of lane boundaries to estimate horizon (2) it determines an Inverse Perspective Mapping (IPM) and camera height from a known lane width and the detected horizon. Distances of the vehicles on the road are then cal- culated by back projecting image point to a ray intersecting the reconstructed road plane. For evaluation, we used li- dar data as ground truth and compare the performance of our algorithm with radar as well as the state-of-the-art deep learning based monocular depth prediction algorithms. The results on three public datasets (Kitti, nuScenes and Lyft level 5) showed that the proposed system maintains a con- sistent RMSE between 6.10 to 7.31.

We present a novel method for the placement of labels corresponding to objects of interest in a video/live feed that satisfies the aforementioned objectives. Our proposed framework, SmartOverlays, first identifies the objects and generates corresponding labels using a YOLOv2 in a video frame; at the same time, Saliency Attention Model (SAM) learns eye fixation points that aid in predicting saliency maps; finally, computes Voronoi partitions of the video frame, choosing the centroids of objects as seed points, to place labels for satisfying the proximity constraints with the object of interest. In addition, our approach incorporates tracking the detected objects in a frame to facilitate temporal coherence between frames that enhances the readability of labels.

Existing IL approaches tend to produce a model that is biased towards either the old classes or new classes, unless with the help of exemplars of the old data. To address this issue, we propose a class-incremental learning paradigm called Deep Model Consolidation (DMC), which works well even when the original training data is not available. The idea is to first train a separate model only for the new classes, and then combine the two individual models trained on data of two distinct set of classes (old classes and new classes) via a novel double distillation training objective. The two existing models are consolidated by exploiting publicly available unlabeled auxiliary data. This overcomes the potential difficulties due to unavailability of original training data.

The bounded memory generates imbalance in favor of new classes and a prediction bias toward them appears. This bias is commonly countered by introducing a data balancing step in addition to the basic network training. We depart from this approach and propose simple but efficient scaling of past classifiers' weights to make them more comparable to those of new classes. Scaling exploits incremental state statistics and is applied to the classifiers learned in the initial state of classes to profit from all their available data.

Significant overheads are required in generating hard samples and/or estimating drop-out patches using extra network branches. In this paper, we improve object detectors using a highly efficient and fine-grain mechanism called Inverted Attention (IA). Different from the original detector network that only focuses on the dominant part of objects, the detector network with IA iteratively inverts attention on feature maps which push the detector to discover new discriminative clues and puts more attention on complementary object parts, feature channels and even context. Our approach (1) operates along both the spatial and channels dimensions of the feature maps; (2) requires no extra training on hard samples, no extra network parameters for attention estimation, and no testing overheads. Experiments show that our approach consistently improved state-of-the-art detectors on benchmark databases.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Huang_Improving_Object_Detection_with_Inverted_Attention_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
Instance Segmentation of Benthic Scale Worms at a Hydrothermal Site,"Bhuvan Malladihalli Shashidhara, Mitchell Scott, Aaron Marburg"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 1314-1323","Subsea hydrothermal vents, typically existing at water depths below natural light penetration, contain diverse and unique macrofaunal environments. Traditionally, long-term ecological observation has been difficult as the extreme depth, temperature and pressure make in situ video surveys challenging. However, the introduction of subsea cabled arrays has allowed for the long time series collection of high definition imagery from these vents. To study the benthic hydrothermal vent environment, we propose an inference pipeline consisting of a U-Net followed by VGG-16 CNN to perform instance segmentation of scale worms, a specific macrofaunal family. The developed pipeline exhibits an average precision (AP) of 0.671 AP@[0.5], despite the difficult camouflaged imagery and low training data inputs. We further explore full pipeline training data requirements, as the dynamic scene in question requires the pipeline to be re-trained on an approximately monthly basis for effective segmentation.

Most existing methods for domain adaptation are specially designed for classification. For object detection, existing methods separate domain shift into image-level shift and instance-level shift and align image-level feature and instance-level feature respectively. However, we find that there are two problems which remain unsolved yet. First, the scale of objects is not the same even in an image. Second, negative transfer can affect model performance if not handled properly. We improve the performance of cross-domain detection from three perspectives: 1) using multiple dilated convolution kernels with different dilation rate to reduce the image-level domain discrepancy; 2) removing images or instances with low transferability to weaken the influence of negative transfer; 3) diversifying distributions by keeping instances' feature away from each other, and then pull them closer to the center of each category, so that make source samples distribution more dispersed and more robust for cross-domain detection.

However, recent work has shown that they do not generalize well to partially occluded objects and to mask attacks. In contrast to DCNNs, compositional models are robust to partial occlusion, however, they are not as discriminative as deep models. In this work, we combine DCNNs and compositional object models to retain the best of both approaches: a discriminative model that is robust to partial occlusion and mask attacks. Our model is learned in two steps. First, a standard DCNN is trained for image classification. Subsequently, we cluster the DCNN features into dictionaries. We show that the dictionary components resemble object part detectors and learn the spatial distribution of parts for each object class. We propose mixtures of compositional models to account for large changes in the spatial activation patterns (e.g. due to changes in the 3D pose of an object). At runtime, an image is first classified by the DCNN in a feedforward manner. The prediction uncertainty is used to detect partially occluded objects, which in turn are classified by the compositional model. Our experimental results demonstrate that combining compositional models and DCNNs resolves a fundamental problem of current deep learning approaches to computer vision: The combined model recognizes occluded objects, even when it has not been exposed to occluded objects during training, while at the same time maintaining high discriminative performance for non-occluded objects.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Kortylewski_Combining_Compositional_Models_and_Deep_Networks_For_Robust_Object_Classification_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

One reason is that they treat all images and faces equally, and ignore the imbalance between easy images and hard images; however large amounts of training images only contain easy faces, which are less helpful to learn robust detectors for hard faces. In this paper, we propose that the robustness of a face detector against hard faces can be improved by learning small faces on hard images. Our intuitions are (1) hard images are the images which contain at least one hard face, thus they facilitate training robust face detectors; (2) most hard faces are small faces and other types of hard faces can be easily shrunk to small faces. To this end, we build an anchor-based deep face detector, which only outputs a single high-resolution feature map with small anchors, to specifically learn small faces and train it by a novel hard image mining strategy which automatically adjusts training weights on images according to their difficulties. Extensive experiments have been conducted on WIDER FACE, FDDB, Pascal Faces, and AFW datasets and our method achieves APs of 95.7, 94.9 and 89.7 on easy, medium and hard WIDER FACE val dataset respectively, which verify the effectiveness of our methods, especially on detecting hard faces.

It tries to answer the pertinent question: given a test sample, should we even try to classify it? We propose a novel solution using the concept of mix-up technique for novelty detection, termed as Segregation Network. During training, a pair of examples are selected from the training data and an interpolated data point using their convex combination is constructed. We develop a suitable loss function to train our model to predict its constituent classes. During testing, each input query is combined with the known class prototypes to generate mixed samples which are then passed through the trained network. Our model which is trained to reveal the constituent classes can then be used to determine whether the sample is novel or not. The intuition is that if a query comes from a known class and is mixed with the set of known class prototypes, then the prediction of the trained model for the correct class should be high. In contrast, for a query from a novel class, the predictions for all the known classes should be low. The proposed model is trained using only the available known class data and does not need access to any auxiliary dataset or attributes.

Therefore, a good representation should account for both of them. In the light of recent success of scene graph in many CV and NLP tasks for describing complex natural scenes, we propose to represent image and text with two kinds of scene graphs: visual scene graph (VSG) and textual scene graph (TSG), each of which is exploited to jointly characterize objects and relationships in the corresponding modality. The image-text retrieval task is then naturally formulated as cross-modal scene graph matching.

While previous studies have achieved much advance by encoding the visual and textual data into a joint space where similar concepts are closely located, they often represent data by a single vector ignoring the presence of multiple important components in an image or text. Thus, in addition to the joint embedding space, we propose a novel multi-head self-attention network to capture various components of visual and textual data by attending to important parts in data. Our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art results in image-text retrieval tasks on MS-COCO and Flicker30K datasets. Through the visualization of the attention maps that capture distinct semantic components at multiple positions in the image and the text, we demonstrate that our method achieves an effective and interpretable visual-semantic joint space.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Park_MHSAN_Multi-Head_Self-Attention_Network_for_Visual_Semantic_Embedding_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
PlotQA: Reasoning over Scientific Plots,"Nitesh Methani, Pritha Ganguly, Mitesh M. Khapra, Pratyush Kumar"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 1527-1536","Existing synthetic datasets (FigureQA, DVQA) for reasoning over plots do not contain variability in data labels, real-valued data, or complex reasoning questions. Consequently, proposed models for these datasets do not fully address the challenge of reasoning over plots. In particular, they assume that the answer comes either from a small fixed size vocabulary or from a bounding box within the image. However, in practice, this is an unrealistic assumption because many questions require reasoning and thus have real-valued answers which appear neither in a small fixed size vocabulary nor in the image. In this work, we aim to bridge this gap between existing datasets and real-world plots. Specifically, we propose PlotQA with 28.9 million question-answer pairs over 224,377 plots on data from real-world sources and questions based on crowd-sourced question templates. Further, 80.76% of the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) questions in PlotQA have answers that are not in a fixed vocabulary. Analysis of existing models on PlotQA reveals that they cannot deal with OOV questions: their overall accuracy on our dataset is in single digits. This is not surprising given that these models were not designed for such questions. As a step towards a more holistic model which can address fixed vocabulary as well as OOV questions, we propose a hybrid approach: Specific questions are answered by choosing the answer from a fixed vocabulary or by extracting it from a predicted bounding box in the plot, while other questions are answered with a table question-answering engine which is fed with a structured table generated by detecting visual elements from the image. On the existing DVQA dataset, our model has an accuracy of 58%, significantly improving on the highest reported accuracy of 46%. On PlotQA, our model has an accuracy of 22.52%, which is significantly better than state of the art models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Methani_PlotQA_Reasoning_over_Scientific_Plots_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

We observe that with the addition of more cues and by minimizing uncertainty in the among cues, the Bayesian network becomes more confident. We propose a Minimizing Uncertainty of Mixture of Cues (MUMC), that minimizes uncertainty present in a mixture of cues experts for generating probabilistic questions. This is a Bayesian framework and the results show a remarkable similarity to natural questions as validated by a human study.

We address both these challenges by using a collaborative correlated module which ensures that even if we do not train for noise based attacks, the enhanced correlation ensures that the right explanation and answer can be generated. We further show that this also aids in improving the generated visual and textual explanations. The use of the correlated module can be thought of as a robust method to verify if the answer and explanations are coherent. We evaluate this model using VQA-X dataset.

Domain-Specific Semantics Guided Approach to Video Captioning,"Hemalatha M, C Chandra Shekhar"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 1587-1596","In video captioning, the description of a video usually relies on the domain to which the video belongs. Typically, the videos belong to wide range domains such as sports, music, news, cooking, etc. In many cases, a video can be associated with more than one domain. In this paper, we propose an approach to video captioning that uses domain-specific decoders. We build a domain classifier to obtain the estimates of probabilities of a video belonging to different domains. For each video, we identify the top-k domains based on the estimated probabilities. Each video in the training data set is shared in training the domain-specific decoders of top-k labels obtained from the domain classifier. The domain-specific decoders use the domain-specific semantic tags for generating captions. The proposed approach uses the Temporal VLAD for preprocessing the features extracted from 2D-CNN and 3D-CNN features. The preprocessed features provide better feature representation of the videos.

Unlike convolution operators, self-attention offers infinite receptive field and enables compute-efficient modeling of global dependencies. However, the existing state-of-the-art attention mechanisms incur high compute and/or parameter overheads, and hence unfit for compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs). In this work, we propose a simple yet effective ""Ultra-Lightweight Subspace Attention Mechanism"" (ULSAM), which infers different attention maps for each feature map subspace. We argue that leaning separate attention maps for each feature subspace enables multi-scale and multi-frequency feature representation, which is more desirable for fine-grained image classification. Our method of subspace attention is orthogonal and complementary to the existing state-of-the-arts attention mechanisms used in vision models. ULSAM is end-to-end trainable and can be deployed as a plug-and- play module in the pre-existing compact CNNs.

In noisy environments, the effect of audio modality is weakened, which further affects the performance of multi-modality speech recognition (MSR). Most of the MSR methods use noisy audio signal as input of the audio modality without any enhancement (filtering the noisy components in the audio signal). In this paper, we propose an audio-enhanced multi-modality speech recognition model. In particular, the proposed model consists of two sub-networks, one is the visual speech enhancement (VE) sub-network and the other is the multi-modality speech recognition (MSR) sub-network. The VE sub-network is able to separate a speaker's voice from background noises when given the corresponding talking face to enhance audio modality. Then the audio modality together with video modality are fed into the MSR sub-network to produce characters. We introduce a pseudo-3D residual network (P3D)-based visual front-end to extract more advantageous visual features. The MSR sub-network is built on top of the Element-wise-Attention Gated Recurrent Unit (EleAtt-GRU) architecture which is more effective than Transformer in long sequences.

Such changes are recorded as an event stream with their positions, timestamps, and polarities continuously, thus there is no notion of 'frame' as in conventional cameras. As many applications including 3D pose estimation use 2D trajectories of feature points, it is necessary to detect and track the feature points robustly and accurately in a continuous event stream. In conventional feature tracking algorithms for event streams, the events in fixed time intervals are converted into the event images by stacking the events at their pixel locations, and the features are tracked in the event images. Such simple stacking of events yields blurry event images due to the camera motion, and it can significantly degrade the tracking quality. We propose to align the events in the time intervals along Bezier curves to minimize the misalignment. Since the camera motion is unknown, the Bezier curve is estimated to maximize the variance of the warped event pixels. Instead of the initial patches for tracking, we use the temporally integrated template patches, as it captures rich texture information from accurately aligned events.

The next step is to detect 3D objects within the 3D frustums these 2D detections define. This is achieved by voxelizing parts of the frustums (since frustums can be really large), instead of using the whole frustums as done in earlier work. The main novelty of our system has to do with determining which parts (3D proposals) of the frustums to voxelize, thus allowing us to provide high resolution representations around the objects of interest.

We tackle both problem settings with 1) same and 2) different action label sets for the source (e.g., Kinectics dataset) and target domains (drone videos). We present a combination of video and instance-based adaptation methods, paired with either a classifier or an embedding-based framework to transfer the knowledge from source to target. Our results show that the proposed adaptation approach substantially improves the performance on these challenging and practical tasks. We further demonstrate the applicability of our method for learning cross-view action recognition on the Charades-Ego dataset.

Orthogonal to this, many practical object detection applications, for example in remote sensing, instead require dealing with large images that contain only a few small objects of a single class, scattered heterogeneously across the space. In addition, they are often subject to strict computational constraints, such as limited battery capacity and computing power. To tackle these more practical scenarios, we propose a novel detection scheme that offers a flexible and efficient framework for detection tasks with variable object sizes and densities: We rely on a sequence of detection stages, each of which has the ability to predict groups of objects as well as individuals. Similar to a detection cascade, this multi-stage architecture spares computational effort by discarding large irrelevant regions of the image early during the detection process. The ability to group objects provides further computational and memory savings, as it allows working with lower image resolutions in early stages, where groups are more easily detected than individuals. We report experimental results on two aerial image datasets, and show that the proposed method is as accurate yet computationally more efficient than standard single-shot detectors, consistently across three different backbone architectures.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Royer_Localizing_Grouped_Instances_for_Efficient_Detection_in_Low-Resource_Scenarios_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

Existing methods, which process hyperspectral data to detect amorphous gases such as CH4 require manual inspection from domain experts and annotation of massive datasets.

The proposed Hyperspectral Mask-RCNN (H-mrcnn) uses principled statistics, signal processing, and deep neural networks to address these limitations. H-mrcnn introduces fast algorithms to analyze large-area hyper-spectral information and methods to autonomously represent and detect CH4 plumes. H-mrcnn processes information by match-filtering sliding windows of hyperspectral data across the spectral bands. This process produces information-rich features that are both effective plume representations and gas concentration analogs.

Multiview Co-segmentation for Wide Baseline Images using Cross-view Supervision,"Yuan Yao, Hyun Soo Park"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 1942-1951","This paper presents a method to co-segment an object from wide baseline multiview images using cross-view self-supervision. A key challenge in the wide baseline images lies in the fragility of photometric matching. Inspired by shape-from-silhouette that does not require photometric matching, we formulate a new theory of shape belief transfer---the segmentation belief in one image can be used to predict that of the other image through epipolar geometry. This formulation is differentiable, and therefore, an end-to-end training is possible. We analyze the shape belief transfer to identify the theoretical upper and lower bounds of the unlabeled data segmentation, which characterizes the degenerate cases of co-segmentation. We design a novel triple network that embeds this shape belief transfer, which is agnostic to visual appearance and baseline. The resulting network is validated by recognizing a target object from realworld visual data including non-human species and a subject of interest in social videos where attaining large-scale annotated data is challenging.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Yao_Multiview_Co-segmentation_for_Wide_Baseline_Images_using_Cross-view_Supervision_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
Shape Constrained Network for Eye Segmentation in the Wild,"Bingnan Luo, Jie Shen, Shiyang Cheng, Yujiang Wang, Maja Pantic"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 1952-1960","Semantic segmentation of eyes has long been a vital pre-processing step in many biometric applications. Majority of the works focus only on high resolution eye images, while little has been done to segment the eyes from low quality images in the wild. However, this is a particularly interesting and meaningful topic, as eyes play a crucial role in conveying the emotional state and mental well-being of a person. In this work, we take two steps toward solving this problem: (1) We collect and annotate a challenging eye segmentation dataset containing 8882 eye patches from 4461 facial images of different resolutions, illumination conditions and head poses; (2) We develop a novel eye segmentation method, Shape Constrained Network (SCN), that incorporates shape prior into the segmentation network training procedure. Specifically, we learn the shape prior from our dataset using VAE-GAN, and leverage the pre-trained encoder and discriminator to regularise the training of SegNet. To improve the accuracy and quality of predicted masks, we replace the loss of SegNet with three new losses: Intersection-over-Union (IoU) loss, shape discriminator loss and shape embedding loss. Extensive experiments shows that our method outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation and landmark detection methods in terms of mean IoU (mIoU) accuracy and the quality of segmentation masks.

Recent approaches to 3D shape segmentation learning heavily rely on high-quality labeled training datasets. This limits their use in applications to handle the large scale unannotated datasets. In this paper, we proposed a novel semi-supervised approach, named Robust Learning of One-Shot 3D Shape Segmentation (ROSS), which only requires one single exemplar labeled shape for training. The proposed ROSS can generalize its ability from a one-shot training process to predict the segmentation for previously unseen 3D shape models. The proposed ROSS is composed of three major modules for 3D shape segmentation as follows. The global shape descriptor generator is the first module that utilizes the proposed reference weighted convolution to learn a 3D shape descriptor. The second module is a part-aware shape descriptor constructor that can generate weighted descriptors from a learned 3D shape descriptor according to semantic parts without supervision. The shape morphing with label transferring works as the last module. It morphs the exemplar shape and then transfers labels from the transformed exemplar shape to the target shape. The extensive experimental results on 3D mesh datasets demonstrate the ROSS is robust to noise and incomplete shapes and it can be applied to unannotated datasets. The experiment shows the proposed ROSS can achieve comparable performance with the supervised method.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Yuan_ROSS_Robust_Learning_of_One-shot_3D_Shape_Segmentation_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

First, because the portrait segmentation is performed in the middle of a whole process, it requires extremely lightweight models. Second, there has not been any public datasets in this domain that contain a sufficient number of images. To solve the first problem, we introduce the new extremely lightweight portrait segmentation model SINet, containing an information blocking decoder and spatial squeeze modules. The information blocking decoder uses confidence estimation to recover local spatial information without spoiling global consistency.

Most commercial star trackers use conventional optical sensors. A recent alternative is to use event sensors, which could enable more energy-efficient and faster star trackers. However, this demands new algorithms that can efficiently cope with high-speed asynchronous data, and are feasible on resource-constrained computing platforms. To this end, we propose an event-based processing approach for star tracking. Our technique operates on the event stream from a star field, by using multiresolution Hough Transforms to time-progressively integrate event data and produce accurate relative rotations. Optimisation via rotation averaging is then used to fuse the relative rotations and jointly refine the absolute orientations. Our technique is designed to be feasible for asynchronous operation on standard hardware. Moreover, compared to state-of-the-art event-based motion estimation schemes, our technique is much more efficient and accurate.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Bagchi_Event-based_Star_Tracking_via_Multiresolution_Progressive_Hough_Transforms_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
Toward Explainable Fashion Recommendation,"Pongsate Tangseng, Takayuki Okatani"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 2153-2162","Many studies have been conducted so far to build systems for recommending fashion items and outfits. Although they achieve good performances in their respective tasks, most of them cannot explain their judgments to the users, which compromises their usefulness. Toward explainable fashion recommendation, this study proposes a system that is able not only to provide a goodness score for an outfit but also to explain the score by providing reason behind it. For this purpose, we propose a method for quantifying how influential each feature of each item is to the score. Using this influence value, we can identify which item and what feature make the outfit good or bad. We represent the image of each item with a combination of human-interpretable features, and thereby the identification of the most influential item-feature pair gives useful explanation of the output score. To evaluate the performance of this approach, we design an experiment that can be performed without human annotation; we replace a single item-feature pair in an outfit so that the score will decrease, and then we test if the proposed method can detect the replaced item-feature pair correctly using the above influence values. The experimental results show that the proposed method can accurately detect bad items in outfits lowering their scores.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Tangseng_Toward_Explainable_Fashion_Recommendation_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

Therefore, in this paper we advance to keep the content information of the input image during the process of style transfer by the power of steganography, with two approaches proposed: a two-stage model and an end-to-end model. We conduct extensive experiments to successfully verify the capacity of our models, in which both of them are able to not only generate stylized images of quality comparable with the ones produced by typical style transfer methods, but also effectively eliminate the artifacts introduced in reconstructing original input from a stylized image as well as performing multiple times of style transfer in series.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Chen_Self-Contained_Stylization_via_Steganography_for_Reverse_and_Serial_Style_Transfer_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

However, images from real-world applications are susceptible to unwanted noise and distractions, that might jeopardize the robustness of such anomaly score. To alleviate this problem, we propose a self-supervised masking method that specifically focuses on discriminative parts of images to enable robust anomaly detection. Our experiments reveal that discriminator's class activation map in adversarial training evolves in three stages and finally fixates on the foreground location in the images. Using this property of the activation map, we construct a mask that suppresses spurious signals from the background thus enabling robust anomaly detection by focusing on local discriminative attributes.

However, the orthogonal setting of transferring knowledge from a pretrained network from a visually different yet semantically close source is rarely considered: This commonly happens with real-life data which is not necessarily as clean as the training source (noise, ge- ometric transformations, different modalities, etc.). To tackle such scenarios, we introduce a new, generalized form of fine-tuning, called flex-tuning, in which any individual unit (e.g. layer) of a network can be tuned, and the most promising one is chosen automatically. In order to make the method appealing for practical use, we propose two lightweight and faster selection procedures that prove to be good approximations in practice. We study these selection criteria empirically across a variety of domain shifts and data scarcity scenarios, and show that fine-tuning individual units, despite its simplicity, yields very good results as an adaptation technique.

Environmental decision making in process engineering critically relies on accurate quantification of microplastic fibers in these images. To satisfy the required standards, images are often analyzed manually, resulting in a highly tedious process, with thousands of fiber instances per image. While the shape of individual fibers is relatively simple, it is difficult to separate them in highly crowded scenes with significant overlap. We propose a fiber instance detection pipeline, which decomposes the fiber detection and segmentation into manageable subproblems.

In contrast to previous methods, which require pairs of original images containing text and images from which the text has been removed, our method does not need corresponding image pairs for training. We use a separately trained scene text detector and an inpainting network. The scene text detector predicts segmentation maps of text instances which are then used as masks for the inpainting network. The network for inpainting, trained on a large-scale image dataset, fills in masked out regions in an input image and generates a final image in which the original text is no longer present.

Conventionally, the single image dehazing problem aims to restore the haze-free image. Previous successful approaches have utilized various hand-crafted features/priors. However, such images suffer from color degradation and halo artifacts. By way of analysis, these artifacts, in general, prevail around the regions with high-intensity variation, such as edgy structures. This finding inspires us to consider the Laplacians of Gaussian (LoG) of the images which exceptionally retains this information, to solve the problem of single image haze removal. In this line of thought, we present an end-to-end model that learns to remove the haze based on the per-pixel difference between LoGs of the dehazed and original haze-free images. The optimization of the proposed network is further enhanced by using the adversarial training and perceptual loss function. The proposed method has been appraised on Synthetic Objective Testing Set (SOTS) and benchmark realworld hazy images using 16 image quality measures. Based on the Color Difference (CIEDE 2000), an improvement of 15.89% has been observed over the state-of-the-art method, Yang et al. [50].

It is a challenging task because the blur due to camera shake, object movement and defocusing is heterogeneous in both temporal and spatial dimensions. Traditional methods train on datasets synthesized with a single level of blur, and thus do not generalize well across levels of blurriness. To address this challenge, we propose a dual attention mechanism to dynamically aggregate temporal cues for deblurring with an end-to-end trainable network structure. Specifically, an internal attention module adaptively selects the optimal temporal scales for restoring the sharp center frame. An external attention module adaptively aggregates and refines multiple sharp frame estimates, from several internal attention modules designed for different blur levels. To train and evaluate on more diverse blur severity levels, we propose a Challenging DVD dataset generated from the raw DVD video set by pooling frames with different temporal windows. Our framework achieves consistently better performance on this more challenging dataset while obtaining strongly competitive results on the original DVD benchmark.

Conversely, conventional images represent scenes in a single viewing direction with a small or limited field of view (FOV). As a result, only certain parts of the scenes are observed, and valuable information about the surroundings is lost. In this paper, a learning-based approach that reconstructs the scene in 360 x 180 from a sparse set of conventional images (typically 4 images) is proposed. The proposed approach first estimates the FOV of input images relative to the panorama. The estimated FOV is then used as the prior for synthesizing a high-resolution 360 panoramic output.

Image deraining is a critical yet highly challenging task, due to the fact that rain density varies across spatial locations, while the distribution patterns simultaneously vary across color channels. In this paper, we propose a variational image deraining (VID) method by formulating image deraining in a conditional variational auto-encoder framework. To achieve adaptive deraining to spatial rain density, we generate a density estimation map for each color channel, which can largely avoid over and under deraining. In addition, to address cross-channel variations, we conduct channel-wise deraining, motivated by our observation that bright pixels do not tend to remain bright after deraining unless there color channels are handled separately.

With the rapid rise of deep learning, many recently proposed video super-resolution methods use convolutional neural networks in conjunction with explicit motion compensation to capitalize on statistical dependencies within and across low-resolution frames. Two common issues of such methods are noteworthy. Firstly, the quality of the final reconstructed HR video is often very sensitive to the accuracy of motion estimation. Secondly, the warp grid needed for motion compensation, which is specified by the two flow maps delineating pixel displacements in horizontal and vertical directions, tends to introduce additional errors and jeopardize the temporal consistency across video frames. To address these issues, we propose a novel dynamic local filter network to perform implicit motion estimation and compensation by employing, via locally connected layers, sample-specific and position-specific dynamic local filters that are tailored to the target pixels. We also propose a global refinement network based on ResBlock and autoencoder structures to exploit non-local correlations and enhance the spatial consistency of super-resolved frames.

This is challenging, even for modern methods that leverage deep neural networks trained to regress to clean images from noisy inputs. One recourse is to rely on ""internal"" image statistics, by searching for similar patterns within the input image itself. In this work, we propose a new method for natural image denoising that trains a deep neural network to determine whether patches in a noisy image input share common underlying patterns. Given a pair of noisy patches, our network predicts whether different sub-band coefficients of the original noise-free patches are similar. The denoising algorithm then aggregates matched coefficients to obtain an initial estimate of the clean image. Finally, this estimate is provided as input, along with the original noisy image, to a standard regression-based denoising network.

Previous unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods address this issue by training a model using unpaired genuine LR and HR data as well as cycle consistency loss formulation. However, this renders the model overstretched with two tasks: consistifying the visual characteristics and enhancing the image resolution. Importantly, this makes the end-to-end model training ineffective due to the difficulty of back-propagating gradients through two concatenated CNNs. To solve this problem, we formulate a method that joins the advantages of conventional SR and UDA models. Specifically, we separate and control the optimisations for characteristics consistifying and image super-resolving by introducing Characteristic Regularisation (CR) between them.

Estimate 3D Camera Pose from 2D Pedestrian Trajectories,"Yan Xu, Vivek Roy, Kris Kitani"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 2579-2588","We consider the task of re-calibrating the 3D pose of a static surveillance camera, whose pose may change due to external forces, such as birds, wind, falling objects or earthquakes. Conventionally, camera pose estimation can be solved with a PnP (Perspective-n-Point) method using 2D-to-3D feature correspondences, when 3D points are known. However, 3D point annotations are not always available or practical to obtain in real-world applications. We propose an alternative strategy for extracting 3D information to solve for camera pose by using pedestrian trajectories. We observe that 2D pedestrian trajectories indirectly contain useful 3D information that can be used for inferring camera pose. To leverage this information, we propose a data-driven approach by training a neural network (NN) regressor to model a direct mapping from 2D pedestrian trajectories projected on the image plane to 3D camera pose. We demonstrate that our regressor trained only on synthetic data can be directly applied to real data, thus eliminating the need to label any real data. We evaluate our method across six different scenes from the Town Centre Street and DUKEMTMC datasets.

Reenactment alterations allow the source to change the target expressions and create photo-realistic images and videos where such modifications are hard to detect. Significant work has been done towards creating such images and videos. However, the detection of such alterations still requires research.

Although existing rPPG-based methods exhibit encouraging results, they require long observation time (10-12 seconds) to identify the heartbeat information, which limits their employment in real applications such as smartphone unlock and e-payment. To shorten the observation time (within 1-second) while keeping the performance, we propose a fast rPPG-based 3D mask presentation attack detection (PAD) method by analyzing the similarity of local facial rPPG signals in the time domain.

Typically, the methods based on this approach operate at a fixed timescale - either a single time-instant (eg frame-based) or a constant time duration (eg video-clip based). But human abnormal activities can take place at different timescales. For example, jumping is a short-term anomaly and loitering is a long-term anomaly in a surveillance scenario. A single and pre-defined timescale is not enough to capture the wide range of anomalies occurring with different time duration. In this paper, we propose a multi-timescale model to capture the temporal dynamics at different timescales.

Despite the recent advances with deep learning (DL) models for spatio-temporal and multi-modal fusion, re-identification approaches often fail to leverage the contextual information (e.g., pose and illu- mination) to dynamically select the most discriminant con- volutional filters (i.e., appearance features) for feature rep- resentation and inference. State-of-the-art techniques for gated fusion employ complex dedicated part- or attention- based architectures for late fusion, and do not incorpo- rate pose and appearance information to train the back- bone network. In this paper, a new DL model is proposed for pose-guided re-identification, comprised of a deep back- bone, pose estimation, and gated fusion network. Given a query image of an individual, the backbone convolutional NN produces a feature embedding required for pair-wise matching with embeddings for reference images, where fea- ture maps from the pose network and from mid-level CNN layers are combined by the gated fusion network to gen- erate pose-guided gating.

To the best of our knowledge, this is a first attempt for simultaneous localization and classification of moving objects in a video, i.e. MOR in a single-stage deep learning framework. We achieve this by labelling axis-aligned bounding boxes for moving objects which requires less computational resources than producing pixel-level estimates. In the proposed MotionRec, both temporal and spatial features are learned using past history and current frames respectively. First, the background is estimated with a temporal depth reductionist (TDR) block. Then the estimated background, current frame and temporal median of recent observations are assimilated to encode spatiotemporal motion saliency. Moreover, feature pyramids are generated from these motion saliency maps to perform regression and classification at multiple levels of feature abstractions. MotionRec works online at inference as it requires only few past frames for MOR. Moreover, it doesn't require predefined target initialization from user.

Crucially, their success relies upon the availability of some annotated frames of the test video during training. Consequently, their performance on completely ""unseen"" videos is undocumented in the literature. In this work, we propose a new, supervised, background-subtraction algorithm for unseen videos (BSUV-Net) based on a fully-convolutional neural network. The input to our network consists of the current frame and two background frames captured at different time scales along with their semantic segmentation maps. In order to reduce the chance of overfitting, we also introduce a new data-augmentation technique which mitigates the impact of illumination difference between the background frames and the current frame.

In contrast to the previous work that aims to solve either the task of pose prediction or trajectory forecasting in isolation, we propose a framework to unify these two problems and address the practically useful task of pedestrian locomotion prediction in the wild. Among the major challenges in solving this task is the scarcity of annotated egocentric video datasets with dense annotations for pose, depth, or egomotion. To surmount this difficulty, we use state-of-the-art models to generate (noisy) annotations and propose robust forecasting models that can learn from this noisy supervision. We present a method to disentangle the overall pedestrian motion into easier to learn subparts by utilizing a pose completion and a decomposition module. The completion module fills in the missing key-point annotations and the decomposition module breaks the cleaned locomotion down to global (trajectory) and local (pose keypoint movements). Further, with Quasi RNN as our backbone, we propose a novel hierarchical trajectory forecasting network that utilizes low-level vision domain specific signals like egomotion and depth to predict the global trajectory.

Despite their desirable traits, their main drawback stems from the fact that the spatial resolution of the imagery acquired by these sensors is low. Moreover, chromatic mapping in snapshot mosaic sensors is not straightforward since the bands delivered by the sensor tend to be narrow and unevenly distributed across the range in which they operate.

In the prevalent regression approach, a model is trained for mapping images to its crowd density rather than counting by detecting every person. This framework is motivated from the difficulty to discriminate humans in highly dense crowds where unfavorable perspective, occlusion and clutter are prevalent. Though regression methods estimate overall crowd counts pretty well, localization of individual persons suffers and varies considerably across the entire density spectrum. Moreover, individual detection of people aids more explainable practical systems than predicting blind crowd count or density map. Hence, we move away from density regression and reformulate the task as localized dot prediction in dense crowds. Our dot detection model, DD-CNN, is trained for pixel-wise binary classification to detect people instead of regressing local crowd density. In order to handle severe scale variation and detect people of all scales with accurate dots, we use a novel multi-scale architecture which does not require any ground truth scale information. This training regime, which incorporates top-down feedback, helps our model to localize people in sparse as well as dense crowds. Our model delivers superior counting performance on major crowd datasets.

This new single-shot interaction classifier estimates interactions simultaneously for all human-object pairs, regardless of their number and class. State-of-the-art approaches adopt a multi-shot strategy based on a pairwise estimate of interactions for a set of human-object candidate pairs, which leads to a complexity depending, at least, on the number of interactions or, at most, on the number of candidate pairs. In contrast, the proposed method estimates the interactions on the whole image. Indeed, it simultaneously estimates all interactions between all human subjects and object targets by performing a single forward pass throughout the image. Consequently, it leads to a constant complexity and computation time independent of the number of subjects, objects or interactions in the image. In detail, interaction classification is achieved on a dense grid of anchors thanks to a joint multi-task network that learns three complementary tasks simultaneously: (i) prediction of the types of interaction, (ii) estimation of the presence of a target and (iii) learning of an embedding which maps interacting subject and target to a same representation, by using a metric learning strategy.

We make use of a network for clear to rain translation trained with the domain bridge to extend our work to Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). In that context, we introduce an online multimodal style-sampling strategy, where image translation multimodality is exploited at training time to improve performances. Finally, a novel approach for self-supervised learning is presented, and used to further align the domains.

In this work, we study the problem of semantic segmentation model in adapting to such hot climate cities. This issue can be circumvented by collecting and annotating images in such weather conditions and training segmentation models on those images. But the task of semantically annotating images for every environment is painstaking and expensive. Hence, we propose a framework that improves the performance of semantic segmentation models without explicitly creating an annotated dataset for such adverse weather variations. Our framework consists of two parts, a restoration network to remove the geometrical distortions caused by hot weather and an adaptive segmentation network that is trained on an additional loss to adapt to the statistics of the ground-truth segmentation map. We train our framework on the Cityscapes dataset, which showed a total IoU gain of 12.707 over standard segmentation models.

Our approach is based on learning a a pruner network to prune a pre-trained target network. The pruner is essentially a multitask deep neural network with binary outputs that help identify the filters from each layer of the original network that do not have any significant contribution to the model and can therefore be pruned. The pruner network has the same architecture as the original network except that it has a multitask/multi-output last layer containing binary-valued outputs (one per filter), which indicate which filters have to be pruned. The pruner's goal is to minimize the number of filters from the original network by assigning zero weights to the corresponding output feature-maps. In contrast to most of the existing methods, instead of relying on iterative pruning, our approach can prune the network (original network) in one go and, moreover, does not require specifying the degree of pruning for each layer (and can learn it instead). The compressed model produced by our approach is generic and does not need any special hardware/software support. Moreover, augmenting with other methods such as knowledge distillation, quantization, and connection pruning can increase the degree of compression for the proposed approach. We show the efficacy of our proposed approach for classification and object detection tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Verma_A_Network_Pruning_Network_Approach_to_Deep_Model_Compression_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

Therefore, it is important to develop algorithms that can leverage off-the-shelf labeled dataset to learn useful knowledge for the target task. While previous works mostly focus on transfer learning from a single source, we study multi-source transfer across domains and tasks (MS-DTT), in a semi-supervised setting.

GradMix follows a meta-learning objective, which assigns layer-wise weights to the source gradients, such that the combined gradient follows the direction that minimize the loss for a small set of samples from the target dataset. In addition, we propose to adaptively adjust the learning rate for each mini-batch based on its importance to the target task, and a pseudo-labeling method to leverage the unlabeled samples in the target domain.

We seek to understand how to improve style transfer. To do so requires quantitative evaluation procedures, but current evaluation is qualitative, mostly involving user studies. We describe a novel quantitative evaluation procedure. Our procedure relies on two statistics: the Effectiveness (E) statistic measures the extent that a given style has been transferred to the target, and the Coherence (C) statistic measures the extent to which the original image's content is preserved. Our statistics are calibrated to human preference: targets with larger values of E (resp C) will reliably be preferred by human subjects in comparisons of style (resp. content). We use these statistics to investigate relative performance of a number of style transfer methods, revealing a number of intriguing properties. Admissible methods lie on a Pareto frontier (i.e. improving E reduces C, or vice versa). Three methods are admissible: Universal style transfer produces very good C but weak E; modifying the optimization used for Gatys' loss produces a method with strong E and strong C; and a modified cross-layer method has slightly better E at strong cost in C. While the histogram loss improves the E statistics of Gatys' method, it does not make the method admissible.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient Interactive Self-Annotation framework to cut down both time and human labor cost for video object bounding box annotation. Our method is based on recurrent self-supervised learning and consists of two processes: automatic process and interactive process, where the automatic process aims to build a supported detector to speed up the interactive process. In the Automatic Recurrent Annotation, we let an off-the-shelf detector watch unlabeled videos repeatedly to reinforce itself automatically. At each iteration, we utilize the trained model from the previous iteration to generate better pseudo ground-truth bounding boxes than those at the previous iteration, recurrently improving self-supervised training the detector. In the Interactive Recurrent Annotation, we tackle the human-in-the-loop annotation scenario where the detector receives feedback from the human annotator. To this end, we propose a novel Hierarchical Correction module, where the annotated frame-distance binarizedly decreases at each time step, to utilize the strength of CNN for neighbor frames.

Also, gaze information, commonly used to infer the area of interest in egocentric vision, is often not dependable. However, blind users often tend to include their hand either interacting with the object that they wish to recognize or simply placing it in proximity for better camera aiming. We propose localization models that leverage the presence of the hand as the contextual information for priming the center area of the object of interest. In our approach, hand segmentation is fed to either the entire localization network or its last convolutional layers. Using egocentric datasets from sighted and blind individuals, we show that the hand-priming achieves higher precision than other approaches, such as fine-tuning, multi-class, and multi-task learning, which also encode hand-object interactions in localization.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Lee_Hand-Priming_in_Object_Localization_for_Assistive_Egocentric_Vision_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
Multimodal Image Outpainting With Regularized Normalized Diversification,"Lingzhi Zhang, Jiancong Wang, Jianbo Shi"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 3433-3442","In this paper, we study the problem of generating a set of realistic and diverse backgrounds when given only a small foreground region. We refer to this task as image outpainting. The technical challenge of this task is to synthesize not only plausible but also diverse image outputs. Traditional generative adversarial networks suffer from mode collapse. While recent approaches propose to maximize or preserve the pairwise distance between generated samples with respect to their latent distance, they do not explicitly prevent the diverse samples of different conditional inputs from collapsing. Therefore, we propose a new regularization method to encourage diverse sampling in this conditional synthesis. In addition, we propose a novel feature pyramid discriminator to improve the image quality.

Prior solutions struggle to maintain reliable accuracy in unconstrained remote gaze tracking. Among them, appearance-based solutions demonstrate tremendous potential in improving gaze accuracy. However, existing works still suffer from head movement and are not robust enough to handle real-world scenarios. Especially most of them study gaze estimation under controlled scenarios where the collected datasets often cover limited ranges of both head-pose and gaze which introduces further bias. In this paper, we propose novel end-to-end appearance-based gaze estimation methods that could more robustly incorporate different levels of head-pose representations into gaze estimation. Our method could generalize to real-world scenarios with low image quality, different lightings and scenarios where direct head-pose information is not available.

All strategies are first based on ranking the training images by their difficulty scores, which are estimated by a state-of-the-art image difficulty predictor. Our first strategy is to divide images into gradually more difficult batches. Our second strategy introduces a novel curriculum loss function for the discriminator that takes into account the difficulty scores of the real images. Our third strategy is based on sampling from an evolving distribution, which favors the easier images during the initial training stages and gradually converges to a uniform distribution, in which samples are equally likely, regardless of difficulty. We compare our curriculum learning strategies with the classic training procedure on two tasks: image generation and image translation. Our experiments indicate that all strategies provide faster convergence and superior results. For example, our best curriculum learning strategy applied on spectrally normalized GANs (SNGANs) fooled human annotators in thinking that generated CIFAR-like images are real in 25.0% of the presented cases, while the SNGANs trained using the classic procedure fooled the annotators in only 18.4% cases. Similarly, in image translation, the human annotators preferred the images produced by the Cycle-consistent GAN (CycleGAN) trained using curriculum learning in 40.5% cases and those produced by CycleGAN based on classic training in only 19.8% cases, 39.7% cases being labeled as ties.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Soviany_Image_Difficulty_Curriculum_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_CuGAN_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

Hand-sketched notes, reflecting those flashes of inspiration, are not limited to text; they can also include drawings and graphics. Napkin backgrounds typically exhibit diverse textural and colour motifs/patterns that may have high visual saliency from a low-level vision standpoint.

Finally, we introduced model blending, a simple and computational efficient method to balance between image and texture quality in the final output, to the task of SISR on 3D images.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Wang_Enhanced_generative_adversarial_network_for_3D_brain_MRI_super-resolution_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
HistoNet: Predicting size histograms of object instances,"Kishan Sharma, Moritz Gold, Christian Zurbruegg, Laura Leal-Taixe, Jan Dirk Wegner"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 3637-3645","We propose to predict histograms of object sizes in crowded scenes directly without any explicit object instance segmentation. What makes this task challenging is the high density of objects (of the same category), which makes instance identification hard. Instead of explicitly segmenting object instances, we show that directly learning histograms of object sizes improves accuracy while using drastically less parameters. This is very useful for application scenarios where explicit, pixel-accurate instance segmentation is not needed, but their lies interest in the overall distribution of instance sizes. Our core applications are in biology, where we estimate the size distribution of soldier fly larvae, and medicine, where we estimate the size distribution of cancer cells as an intermediate step to calculate tumor cellularity score. Given an image with hundreds of small object instances, we output the total count and the size histogram. We also provide a new data set for this task, the FlyLarvae data set, which consists of 11,000 larvae instances labeled pixel-wise. Our method results in an overall improvement in the count and size distribution prediction as compared to state-of-the-art instance segmentation method Mask R-CNN.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Sharma_HistoNet_Predicting_size_histograms_of_object_instances_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
3D semi-supervised learning with uncertainty-aware multi-view co-training,"Yingda Xia, Fengze Liu, Dong Yang, Jinzheng Cai, Lequan Yu, Zhuotun Zhu, Daguang Xu, Alan Yuille, Holger Roth"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 3646-3655","While making a tremendous impact in various fields, deep neural networks usually require large amounts of labeled data for training which are expensive to collect in many applications, especially in the medical domain. Unlabeled data, on the other hand, is much more abundant. Semi-supervised learning techniques, such as co-training, could provide a powerful tool to leverage unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, uncertainty-aware multi-view co-training (UMCT), to address semi-supervised learning on 3D data, such as volumetric data from medical imaging. In our work, co-training is achieved by exploiting multi-viewpoint consistency of 3D data. We generate different views by rotating or permuting the 3D data and utilize asymmetrical 3D kernels to encourage diversified features in different sub-networks. In addition, we propose an uncertainty-weighted label fusion mechanism to estimate the reliability of each view's prediction with Bayesian deep learning. As one view requires the supervision from other views in co-training, our self-adaptive approach computes a confidence score for the prediction of each unlabeled sample in order to assign a reliable pseudo label. Thus, our approach can take advantage of unlabeled data during training. We show the effectiveness of our proposed semi-supervised method on several public datasets from medical image segmentation tasks (NIH pancreas & LiTS liver tumor dataset). Meanwhile, a fully-supervised method based on our approach achieved state-of-the-art performances on both the LiTS liver tumor segmentation and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) challenge, demonstrating the robustness and value of our framework, even when fully supervised training is feasible.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Xia_3D_semi-supervised_learning_with_uncertainty-aware_multi-view_co-training_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv
IterNet: Retinal Image Segmentation Utilizing Structural Redundancy in Vessel Networks,"Liangzhi Li, Manisha Verma, Yuta Nakashima, Hajime Nagahara, Ryo Kawasaki"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 3656-3665","Retinal vessel segmentation is of great interest for diagnosis of retinal vascular diseases. To further improve the performance of vessel segmentation, we propose IterNet, a new model based on UNet, with the ability to find obscured details of the vessel from the segmented vessel image itself, rather than the raw input image. IterNet consists of multiple iterations of a mini-UNet, which can be 4X deeper than the common UNet. IterNet also adopts the weight-sharing and skip-connection features to facilitate training; therefore, even with such a large architecture, IterNet can still learn from merely 10 20 labeled images, without pre-training or any prior knowledge. IterNet achieves AUCs of 0.9816, 0.9851, and 0.9881 on three mainstream datasets, namely DRIVE, CHASE-DB1, and STARE, respectively, which currently are the best scores in the literature.

Star-convex Polyhedra for 3D Object Detection and Segmentation in Microscopy,"Martin Weigert, Uwe Schmidt, Robert Haase, Ko Sugawara, Gene Myers"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2020, pp. 3666-3673","Accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei in volumetric (3D) fluorescence microscopy datasets is an important step in many biomedical research projects. Although many automated methods for these tasks exist, they often struggle for images with low signal-to-noise ratios and/or dense packing of nuclei. It was recently shown for 2D microscopy images that these issues can be alleviated by training a neural network to directly predict a suitable shape representation (star-convex polygon) for cell nuclei. In this paper, we adopt and extend this approach to 3D volumes by using star-convex polyhedra to represent cell nuclei and similar shapes. To that end, we overcome the challenges of 1) finding parameter-efficient star-convex polyhedra representations that can faithfully describe cell nuclei shapes, 2) adapting to anisotropic voxel sizes often found in fluorescence microscopy datasets, and 3) efficiently computing intersections between pairs of star-convex polyhedra (required for non-maximum suppression). Although our approach is quite general, since star-convex polyhedra include common shapes like bounding boxes and spheres as special cases, our focus is on accurate detection and segmentation of cell nuclei. Finally, we demonstrate on two challenging datasets that our approach (StarDist-3D) leads to superior results when compared to classical and deep learning based methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_WACV_2020/html/Weigert_Star-convex_Polyhedra_for_3D_Object_Detection_and_Segmentation_in_Microscopy_WACV_2020_paper.html,2020,wacv

At its core, the package uses PyTorch as its main backend both for efficiency and to take advantage of the reverse-mode auto-differentiation to define and compute the gradient of complex functions. Inspired by OpenCV, Kornia is composed of a set of modules containing operators that can be inserted inside neural networks to train models to perform image transformations, camera calibration, epipolar geometry, and low level image processing techniques such as filtering and edge detection that operate directly on high dimensional tensor representations.
