Towards Contextual Learning in Few-Shot Object Classification,"Mathieu Page Fortin, Brahim Chaib-draa"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 3279-3288","Few-shot Learning (FSL) aims to classify new concepts from a small number of examples. While there have been an increasing amount of work on few-shot object classification in the last few years, most current approaches are limited to images with only one centered object. On the opposite, humans are able to leverage prior knowledge to quickly learn new concepts, such as semantic relations with contextual elements. Inspired by the concept of contextual learning in educational sciences, we propose to make a step towards adopting this principle in FSL by studying the contribution that context can have in object classification in a low-data regime. To this end, we first propose an approach to perform FSL on images of complex scenes. We develop two plug-and-play modules that can be incorporated into existing FSL methods to enable them to leverage contextual learning. More specifically, these modules are trained to weight the most important context elements while learning a particular concept, and then use this knowledge to ground visual class representations in context semantics. Extensive experiments on Visual Genome and Open Images show the superiority of contextual learning over learning individual objects in isolation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Fortin_Towards_Contextual_Learning_in_Few-Shot_Object_Classification_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV
Multimodal Humor Dataset: Predicting Laughter Tracks for Sitcoms,"Badri N. Patro, Mayank Lunayach, Deepankar Srivastava, Sarvesh, Hunar Singh, Vinay P. Namboodiri"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 576-585","A great number of situational comedies (sitcoms) are being regularly made and the task of adding laughter tracks to these is a critical task. Providing an ability to be able to predict whether something will be humorous to the audience is also crucial. In this project, we aim to automate this task. Towards doing so, we annotate an existing sitcom (`Big Bang Theory') and use the laughter cues present to obtain a manual annotation for this show. We provide detailed analysis for the dataset design and further evaluate various state of the art baselines for solving this task. We observe that existing LSTM and BERT based networks on the text alone do not perform as well as joint text and video or only video-based networks. Moreover, it is challenging to ascertain that the words attended to while predicting laughter are indeed humorous. Our dataset and analysis provided through this paper is a valuable resource towards solving this interesting semantic and practical task. As an additional contribution, we have developed a novel model for solving this task that is a multi-modal self-attention based model that outperforms currently prevalent models for solving this task.

Self-Supervised Learning for Domain Adaptation on Point Clouds,"Idan Achituve, Haggai Maron, Gal Chechik"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 123-133","Self-supervised learning (SSL) is a technique for learning useful representations from unlabeled data. It has been applied effectively to domain adaptation (DA) on images and videos. It is still unknown if and how it can be leveraged for domain adaptation in 3D perception problems.

We introduce a new family of pretext tasks, Deformation Reconstruction, inspired by the deformations encountered in sim-to-real transformations.

Efficient 3D Video Engine Using Frame Redundancy,"Gao Peng, Bo Pang, Cewu Lu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 3792-3802","Traditional 3d video understanding methods process videos frame by frame. We argue that a lot of computation in this mechanism is redundant based on a key observation - adjacent frames in 3D videos have visually similar geometry structure. To handle the redundancy, we propose the Efficient 3D Video Engine (EVE), aiming to avoid the computation of redundant points. It consists of two modules: 1) redundancy removing module designed to detect redundancy and remove it; 2) residual learning module to extract features on non-redundant points. As a simple plug and play framework, EVE can be easily incorporated in main-stream 3D models. Experiments demonstrate that EVE can significantly reduce computation without performance loss on large scale datasets. On the other hand, with similar computation, EVE outperforms the strong baseline by up to 4.1 mIoU on SemanticKITTI.

Exploiting the Redundancy in Convolutional Filters for Parameter Reduction,"Kumara Kahatapitiya, Ranga Rodrigo"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 1410-1420","Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks over the years. However, this comes at the cost of heavy computation and memory intensive network designs, suggesting potential improvements in efficiency. Convolutional layers of CNNs partly account for such an inefficiency, as they are known to learn redundant features. In this work, we exploit this redundancy, observing it as the correlation between convolutional filters of a layer, and propose an alternative approach to reproduce it efficiently. The proposed 'LinearConv' layer learns a set of orthogonal filters, and a set of coefficients that linearly combines them to introduce a controlled redundancy. We introduce a correlation-based regularization loss to achieve such flexibility over redundancy, and control the number of parameters in turn. This is designed as a plug-and-play layer to conveniently replace a conventional convolutional layer, without any additional changes required in the network architecture or the hyperparameter settings. Our experiments verify that LinearConv models achieve a performance on-par with their counterparts, with almost a 50% reduction in parameters on average, and the same computational requirement and speed at inference.

However, measuring the overall progress towards solving this problem is difficult due to the lack of publicly available benchmarks and common training and evaluation procedures. To this end, we introduce a benchmark based on two public datasets for pedestrian behavior understanding. Using the proposed evaluation procedures, we rank a number of baseline and state-of-the-art models and analyze their performance with respect to various properties of the data.

Regional Attention Networks With Context-Aware Fusion for Group Emotion Recognition,"Ahmed Shehab Khan, Zhiyuan Li, Jie Cai, Yan Tong"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 1150-1159","Group Emotion Recognition (GER) from images has many inherent challenges. Specifically, it is difficult to combine diverse emotions of different individuals into a single conclusive label. In addition, although utilization of information other than faces like scene and objects has proven helpful, it is still a challenge to effectively fuse predictions of individual sources. In this work, we proposed solutions to these two problems. First, we developed a regional attention mechanism to find important persons or objects, which play critical roles in the group emotion, and combine them based on importance. Second, we proposed a context-aware fusion mechanism to estimate weights from the image context to fuse different sources of information. Finally, we proposed to use a single backbone network to extract features from multiple sources, i.e., scene, faces, and objects, cutting down computation and memory cost. Experiments on two GER datasets have shown that the proposed framework achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art.

Auxiliary Tasks for Efficient Learning of Point-Goal Navigation,"Saurabh Satish Desai, Stefan Lee"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 717-725","Top-performing approaches to embodied AI tasks like point-goal navigation often rely on training agents via reinforcement learning over tens of millions (or even billions) of experiential steps -- learning neural agents that map directly from visual observations to actions. In this work, we question whether these extreme training durations are necessary or if they are simply due to the difficulty of learning visual representations purely from task reward. We examine the task of point-goal navigation in photorealistic environments and introduce three auxiliary tasks that encourage learned representations to capture key elements of the task -- local scene geometry, transition dynamics of the environment, and progress towards the goal. Importantly, these can be evaluated independent of task performance and provide strong supervision for representation learning. Our auxiliary tasks are simple to implement and rely on supervision already present in simulators commonly used for point-goal navigation. Applying our auxiliary losses to agents from prior works, we observe a greater than 4 times improvement in sample efficiency -- in 17 million steps, our augmented agents outperform state-of-the-art agents after 72 million steps.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Desai_Auxiliary_Tasks_for_Efficient_Learning_of_Point-Goal_Navigation_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

To this end, we present a novel two-stage multi-modal fusion network for 3D object detection, taking both binocular images and raw point clouds as input. The whole architecture facilitates two-stage fusion. The first stage aims at producing 3D proposals through point-wise feature fusion. Within the first stage, we further exploit a joint anchor mechanism that enables the network to utilize 2D-3D classification and regression simultaneously for better proposal generation. The second stage works on the 2D and 3D proposal regions and fuses their features. In addition, we propose to use pseudo LiDAR points from stereo matching as a data augmentation method to densify the LiDAR points, as we observe that objects missed by the detection network mostly have too few points, especially for far-away objects. Our experiments on the KITTI dataset show that the proposed multi-stage fusion helps the network to learn better representations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Zhu_Cross-Modality_3D_Object_Detection_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

A probabilistic latent variable model infers the distribution of the prototype that is treated as the latent variable. We formulate the optimization as a variational inference problem, which is established with an amortized inference network based on an auto-encoder architecture. The probabilistic modeling of the prototype enhances its generalization ability to handle the inherent uncertainty caused by limited data and the huge intra-class variations of objects. Moreover, it offers a principled way to incorporate the prototype extracted from support images into the prediction of the segmentation maps for query images. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation on three benchmark datasets.

The discrepancy between features and attributes is minimized by solving an optimal transport problem. Specifically, we build a conditional generative model to generate features from seen-class attributes, and establish an optimal transport between the distribution of the generated features and that of the real features. The generative model and the optimal transport are optimized iteratively with an attribute-based regularizer, that further enhances the discriminative power of the generated features. A classifier is learned based on the features generated for both the seen and unseen classes. In addition to generalized zero-shot learning, our framework is also applicable to standard and transductive ZSL problems.

Then, we combine textual features with salient image regions to exploit the complementary information carried by the two sources. Specifically, we employ a Graph Convolutional Network to perform multi-modal reasoning and obtain relationship-enhanced features by learning a common semantic space between salient objects and text found in an image.

PI-Net: Pose Interacting Network for Multi-Person Monocular 3D Pose Estimation,"Wen Guo, Enric Corona, Francesc Moreno-Noguer, Xavier Alameda-Pineda"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 2796-2806","Recent literature addressed the monocular 3D pose estimation task very satisfactorily. In these studies, different persons are usually treated as independent pose instances to estimate. However, in many every-day situations, people are interacting, and the pose of an individual depends on the pose of his/her interactees. In this paper, we investigate how to exploit these dependency to enhance current, and possibly future, deep networks for 3D monocular pose estimation. Our pose interacting network, or PI-Net, inputs the initial pose estimates of a variable number of interactees into a recurrent network used to refine the pose of the person-of-interest. Evaluating such a method is challenging due to the limited availability of public annotated multi-person 3D human pose datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the MuPoTS dataset, setting the new state-of-the-art on it.

The automatic identification of boats in monitoring images facilitates conservation, research and patrolling efforts. However, the diverse sizes of vessels, the highly dynamic water surface and weather-related visibility issues significantly hinder this task.

We propose a detection approach that combines state-of-the-art object detectors and a novel Detector of Small Marine Vessels (DSMV) to identify boats of any size. The DSMV uses a short time series of images and a novel bi-directional Gaussian Mixture technique to determine motion in combination with context-based filtering and a DL-based image classifier.

Temporal Stochastic Softmax for 3D CNNs: An Application in Facial Expression Recognition,"Theo Ayral, Marco Pedersoli, Simon Bacon, Eric Granger"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 3029-3038","Training deep learning models for accurate spatiotemporal recognition of facial expressions in videos requires significant computational resources. For practical reasons, 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) are usually trained with relatively short clips randomly extracted from videos. However, such uniform sampling is generally sub-optimal because equal importance is assigned to each temporal clip. In this paper, we present a strategy for efficient video-based training of 3D CNNs. It relies on softmax temporal pooling and a weighted sampling mechanism to select the most relevant training clips. The proposed softmax strategy provides several advantages - a reduced computational complexity due to efficient clip sampling, and an improved accuracy since temporal weighting focuses on more relevant clips during both training and inference. Experimental results obtained with the proposed method on several facial expression recognition benchmarks show the benefits of focusing on more informative clips in training videos. In particular, our approach improves performance and computational cost by reducing the impact of inaccurate trimming and coarse annotation of videos, and heterogeneous distribution of visual information across time.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Ayral_Temporal_Stochastic_Softmax_for_3D_CNNs_An_Application_in_Facial_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV
Scale Aware Adaptation for Land-Cover Classification in Remote Sensing Imagery,"Xueqing Deng, Yi Zhu, Yuxin Tian, Shawn Newsam"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 2160-2169","Land-cover classification using remote sensing imagery is an important Earth observation task. Recently, land cover classification has benefited from the development of fully connected neural networks for semantic segmentation. The benchmark datasets available for training deep segmentation models in remote sensing imagery tend to be small, however, often consisting of only a handful of images from a single location with a single scale. This limits the models' ability to generalize to other datasets. Domain adaptation has been proposed to improve the models' generalization but we find these approaches are not effective for dealing with the scale variation commonly found between remote sensing image collections. We therefore propose a scale aware adversarial learning framework to perform joint cross-location and cross-scale land-cover classification. The framework has a dual discriminator architecture with a standard feature discriminator as well as a novel scale discriminator. We also introduce a scale attention module which produces scale-enhanced features.

SoFA: Source-Data-Free Feature Alignment for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Hao-Wei Yeh, Baoyao Yang, Pong C. Yuen, Tatsuya Harada"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 474-483","Applying a trained model on a new scenario may suffer from domain shift. Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) has been proven to be an effective approach to solve the problem of domain shift by leveraging both data from the scenario that the model was trained on (source) and the new scenario (target). Although the source data are available for training the source model, there is no guarantee that the source data will still be available when applying UDA in the future due to emerging regulations on privacy of data. This results in the in-applicability of most existing UDA methods in the absence of source data. This paper proposes a source-data-free feature alignment (SoFA) method to address this problem by only using the trained source model and unlabeled target data. The source model is used to predict the labels for target data, and we model the generation process from predicted classes to input data to infer the latent features for alignment. Specifically, a mixture of Gaussian distributions is induced from the predicted classes as the reference distribution. The encoded target features are then aligned to the reference distribution via variational inference to extract class semantics without accessing source data. Relationship of the proposed method and the theory of domain adaptation is provided to verify the performance. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves higher or comparable accuracy compared to the existing methods in several cross-dataset classification tasks.

Our approach uses a cross-modal decoder and a composite triplet loss. The cross-modal decoder enforces a constraint that the class label text features can be reconstructed from the audio and video embeddings of data points. This helps the audio and video embeddings to move closer to the class label text embedding. The composite triplet loss makes use of the audio, video, and text embeddings. It helps bring the embeddings from the same class closer and push away the embeddings from different classes in a multi-modal setting. This helps the network to perform better on the multi-modal zero-shot learning task. Importantly, our multi-modal zero-shot learning approach works even if a modality is missing at test time. We test our approach on the generalized zero-shot classification and retrieval tasks and show that our approach outperforms other models in the presence of a single modality as well as in the presence of multiple modalities.

In this paper, we propose to alleviate these problems by means of a novel gaze redirection framework which exploits both a numerical and a pictorial direction guidance, jointly with a coarse-to-fine learning strategy. Specifically, the coarse branch learns the spatial transformation which warps input image according to desired gaze.

However, hand-crafting a multi-domain/task model can be both tedious and challenging. This paper proposes a novel approach to automatically learn a multi-path network for multi-domain visual classification on mobile devices. The proposed multi-path network is learned from neural architecture search by applying one reinforcement learning controller for each domain to select the best path in the super-network created from a MobileNetV3-like search space. An adaptive balanced domain prioritization algorithm is proposed to balance optimizing the joint model on multiple domains simultaneously. The determined multi-path model selectively shares parameters across domains in shared nodes while keeping domain-specific parameters within non-shared nodes in individual domain paths. This approach effectively reduces the total number of parameters and FLOPS, encouraging positive knowledge transfer while mitigating negative interference across domains. Extensive evaluations on the Visual Decathlon dataset demonstrate that the proposed multi-path model achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy, model size, and FLOPS against other approaches using MobileNetV3-like architectures.

This paper proposes a generative model (VI-Net) based on a cosine-classifier baseline. Specifically, we construct a framework to learn to define a generating space for each category in the latent space based on few support samples. In this way, new feature vectors can be generated to help make the decision boundary of classifier sharper during the fine-tuning process. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, we perform comparative experiments and ablation studies on mini-ImageNet and CUB. Experimental results show that VI-Net does improve performance compared with the baseline and obtains the state-of-the-art result among other augmentation-based methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Luo_Few-Shot_Learning_via_Feature_Hallucination_With_Variational_Inference_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV
Line Art Correlation Matching Feature Transfer Network for Automatic Animation Colorization,"Qian Zhang, Bo Wang, Wei Wen, Hai Li, Junhui Liu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 3872-3881","Automatic animation line art colorization is a challenging computer vision problem, since the information of the line art is highly sparse and abstracted and there exists a strict requirement for the color and style consistency between frames. Recently, a lot of Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) based image-to-image translation methods for single line art colorization have emerged. They can generate perceptually appealing results conditioned on line art images. However, these methods can not be adopted for the purpose of animation colorization because there is a lack of consideration of the in-between frame consistency. Existing methods simply input the previous colored frame as a reference to color the next line art, which will mislead the colorization due to the spatial misalignment of the previous colored frame and the next line art especially at positions where apparent changes happen. To address these challenges, we design a kind of correlation matching feature transfer model (called CMFT) to align the colored reference feature in a learnable way and integrate the model into an U-Net based generator in a coarse-to-fine manner. This enables the generator to transfer the layer-wise synchronized features from the deep semantic code to the content progressively. Extension evaluation shows that CMFT model can effectively improve the in-between consistency and the quality of colored frames especially when the motion is intense and diverse.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Zhang_Line_Art_Correlation_Matching_Feature_Transfer_Network_for_Automatic_Animation_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

These unique capabilities have enabled SPADs to be used in applications like LiDAR, non-line-of-sight imaging and fluorescence microscopy that require imaging in photon-starved scenarios. In this work we harness these capabilities for dealing with motion blur in a passive imaging setting in low illumination conditions. Our key insight is that the data captured by a SPAD array camera can be represented as a 3D spatio-temporal tensor of photon detection events which can be integrated along arbitrary spatio-temporal trajectories with dynamically varying integration windows, depending on scene motion. We propose an algorithm that estimates pixel motion from photon timestamp data and dynamically adapts the integration windows to minimize motion blur. Our simulation results show the applicability of this algorithm to a variety of motion profiles including translation, rotation and local object motion.

We find that simply estimating and adapting the BN statistics on a few (32 for instance) representation samples, without retraining the model, improves the corruption robustness by a large margin on several benchmark datasets with a wide range of model architectures. For example, on ImageNet-C, statistics adaptation improves the top1 accuracy of ResNet50 from 39.2% to 48.7%.

This provides strong cross-modal interaction for effective transfer of knowledge between visual and semantic domains. Furthermore, existing methods train the zero-shot classifier either on generate synthetic image features or latent embeddings produced by leveraging representation learning.

Yet, in contexts such as robotics and augmented reality, it is often necessary to find a specific object instance--a unique toy or a custom industrial part for example--rather than a generic object class. Here, applications can require a rapid shift from one object instance to another, thus requiring fast turnaround which affords little-to-no training time. What is more, gathering a dataset and training a model for every new object instance to be detected can be an expensive and time-consuming process. In this context, we propose a generic 2D object instance detection approach that uses example viewpoints of the target object at test time to retrieve its 2D location in RGB images, without requiring any additional training (i.e. fine-tuning) step. To this end, we present an end-to-end architecture that extracts global and local information of the object from its viewpoints.

We propose to solve this problem from a different perspective where we don't need any proposals. SSA2D is a unified network, which performs pixel level joint actor-action detection in a single-shot, where every pixel of the detected actor is assigned an action label. SSA2D has two main advantages: 1) It is a fully convolutional network which does not require any proposals and post-processing making it memory as well as time efficient, 2) It is easily scalable to dense video scenes as its memory requirement is independent of the number of actors present in the scene.

Adversarial parties can extract that information given the ability to access or query the network. In this paper, we propose a novel privacy-preserving mechanism for training deep neural networks. Our approach adds decaying Gaussian noise to the gradients at every training iteration. This is in contrast to the mainstream approach adopted by Google's TensorFlow Privacy, which employs the same noise scale in each step of the whole training process. Compared to existing methods, our proposed approach provides an explicit closed-form mathematical expression to approximately estimate the privacy loss. It is easy to compute and can be useful when the users would like to decide proper training time, noise scale, and sampling ratio during the planning phase.

Context dependency is essential for semantic segmentation, however, its transferability is still not well understood. Furthermore, how to transfer contextual information across two domains remains unexplored. Motivated by this, we propose a cross-attention mechanism based on self-attention to capture context dependencies between two domains and adapt transferable context. To achieve this goal, we design two cross-domain attention modules to adapt context dependencies from both spatial and channel views. Specifically, the spatial attention module captures local feature dependencies between each position in the source and target image. The channel attention module models semantic dependencies between each pair of cross-domain channel maps.

Motivated by this, we develop a neural network that takes NECT images and generates their CECT counterparts. Learning such a network is extremely challenging since NECT and CECT images for training are not aligned even at the same location of the same patient due to movements of internal organs.

However, state-of-the-art pose estimators struggle in obtaining high-quality 2D or 3D pose data due to occlusion, truncation and low-resolution in real-world un-annotated videos. Hence, in this work, we propose 1) a Selective Spatio-Temporal Aggregation mechanism, named SST-A, that refines and smooths the keypoint locations extracted by multiple expert pose estimators, 2) an effective weakly-supervised self-training framework which leverages the aggregated poses as pseudo ground-truth instead of handcrafted annotations for real-world pose estimation. Extensive experiments are conducted for evaluating not only the upstream pose refinement but also the downstream action recognition performance on four datasets, Toyota Smarthome, NTU-RGB+D, Charades, and Kinetics-50. We demonstrate that the skeleton data refined by our Pose-Refinement system (SSTA-PRS) is effective at boosting various existing action recognition models, which achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance.

Long-Range Attention Network for Multi-View Stereo,"Xudong Zhang, Yutao Hu, Haochen Wang, Xianbin Cao, Baochang Zhang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 3782-3791","Learning-based multi-view stereo (MVS) has recently gained great popularity, which can efficiently infer depth map and reconstruct fine-grained scene geometry. Previous methods calculate the variance of the corresponding pixel pairs to determine whether they are matched mostly based on the pixel-wise measure, which fails to consider the interdependence among pixels and is ineffective on the matching of texture-less or occluded regions. These false matching problems challenge MVS and result in its most failure cases. To address the issues, we introduce a Long-range Attention Network (LANet) to selectively aggregate reference features to each position to capture the long-range interdependence across the entire space. As a result, similar features relate to each other regardless of their distance, propagating more guiding information for the effective match. Furthermore, we introduce a new loss to supervise the intermediate probability volume by constraining its distribution reasonably centered at the true depth. Extensive experiments on large-scale DTU dataset demonstrate that the proposed LANet achieves the new state-of-the-art performance, outperforming previous methods by a large margin.

Domain-Adaptive Few-Shot Learning,"An Zhao, Mingyu Ding, Zhiwu Lu, Tao Xiang, Yulei Niu, Jiechao Guan, Ji-Rong Wen"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 1390-1399","Existing few-shot learning (FSL) methods make the implicit assumption that the few target class samples are from the same domain as the source class samples. However, in practice, this assumption is often invalid -- the target classes could come from a different domain. This poses an additional challenge of domain adaptation (DA) with few training samples. In this paper, the problem of domain-adaptive few-shot learning (DA-FSL) is tackled, which is expected to have wide use in real-world scenarios and requires solving FSL and DA in a unified framework. To this end, we propose a novel domain-adversarial prototypical network (DAPN) model. It is designed to address a specific challenge in DA-FSL: the DA objective means that the source and target data distributions need to be aligned, typically through a shared domain-adaptive feature embedding space; but the FSL objective dictates that the target domain per class distribution must be different from that of any source domain class, meaning aligning the distributions across domains may harm the FSL performance. How to achieve global domain distribution alignment whilst maintaining source/target per-class discriminativeness thus becomes the key. Our solution is to explicitly enhance the source/target per-class separation before domain-adaptive feature embedding learning, to alleviate the negative effect of domain alignment on FSL. Extensive experiments show that our DAPN outperforms the state-of-the-arts.

As Auto-Navigator can obtain a direct supervision in every step, such guidance greatly facilitates architecture search. In particular, we initialize our Auto-Navigator with a learnable distribution over the search space of visual perception architecture, and then optimize the distribution with IL supervision. Afterwards, we employ an RL reward function to fine-tune our Auto-Navigator to improve the generalization ability of our model.

Much research in this area aims at improving loss functions or network architectures. Most works, however, do not leverage self-supervision to its full potential. They stick to the standard closed world train-test pipeline, assuming the network parameters to be fixed after the training is finished. Such an assumption does not allow to adapt to new scenes, whereas with self-supervision this becomes possible without extra annotations. In this paper, we propose a novel self-supervised Continuous Monocular Depth Adaptation method (CoMoDA), which adapts the pretrained model on a test video on the fly. As opposed to existing test-time refinement methods that use isolated frame triplets, we opt for continuous adaptation, making use of the previous experience from the same scene.

Nowadays, most deep learning based approaches are implemented with seminal backbone networks, among them the two arguably most famous ones are ResNet and DenseNet. Despite their competitive performance and overwhelming popularity, inherent drawbacks exist for both of them. For ResNet, the identity shortcut that stabilizes training might limit its representation capacity, and DenseNet mitigates it with multi-layer feature concatenation. However, the dense concatenation causes a new problem of requiring high GPU memory and more training time. Partially due to this, it is not a trivial choice between ResNet and DenseNet. This paper provides a unified perspective of dense summation to analyze them, which facilitates a better understanding of their core difference. We further propose dense weighted normalized shortcuts as a solution to the dilemma between them. Our proposed dense shortcut inherits the design philosophy of simple design in ResNet and DenseNet. On several benchmark datasets, the experimental results show that the proposed DSNet achieves significantly better results than ResNet, and achieves comparable performance as DenseNet but requiring fewer computation resources.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Zhang_ResNet_or_DenseNet_Introducing_Dense_Shortcuts_to_ResNet_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

Deep learning classifiers have led to high accuracy results across a wide variety of medical imaging problems, but they need large amounts of labeled data. Given a fundus image, we aim to evaluate various solutions for learning deep neural classifiers using small labeled data for three tasks related to eye disease prediction: (T1) predicting one of the five broad categories - diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, melanoma and normal, (T2) predicting one of the 320 fine-grained disease sub-categories, (T3) generating a textual diagnosis. The problem is challenging because of small data size, need for predictions across multiple tasks, handling image variations, and large number of hyper-parameter choices. Modeling the problem under a multi-task learning (MTL) setup, we investigate the contributions of each of the proposed tasks while dealing with a small amount of labeled data.

When consumer images are not available beforehand, such training is impossible. In this paper, we focus on this challenging and yet practical scenario, and we propose instead to leverage representations learned for cross-domain retrieval from another source dataset and to adapt them to the target dataset for this particular setting. More precisely, we bypass the lack of consumer images and directly target the more challenging meta-domain gap which occurs between consumer images and shop images, independently of their dataset. Assuming that datasets share some similar fashion items, we cluster their shop images and leverage the clusters to automatically generate pseudo-labels.

In this paper, we aim to leverage this asymmetry and train a diverse ensemble of models with very high recall, while sacrificing their precision. Our core idea is straightforward: A diverse ensemble of low precision and high recall models are likely to make different false positive errors (classifying background as foreground in different parts of the image), but the true positives will tend to be consistent. Thus, in aggregate the false positive errors will cancel out, yielding high performance for the ensemble. Our strategy is general and can be applied with any segmentation model.

To this end, we propose to use an off-the-shelf state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction model to estimate the depth and create a large-scale RGB-Depth dataset after a manual data clean-up process. We utilise this dataset to minimise the novel depth consistency loss via adversarial learning (note we do not have ground truth depth maps for generated face images) and the depth categorical loss of synthetic data on the discriminator. In addition, to improve the generalisation and lower the bias of the depth parameters, we propose to use a novel confidence regulariser on the discriminator side of the framework. We extensively performed both quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two publicly available challenging facial expression benchmarks: AffectNet and RaFD. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the competitive baseline and existing arts by a large margin.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Bodur_3D_Dense_Geometry-Guided_Facial_Expression_Synthesis_by_Adversarial_Learning_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

These networks are appealing because they replace laborious hand engineered building blocks but their black-box nature makes them difficult to delve in case of failure. Recent works have shown the importance of using an explicit intermediate representation that has the benefits of increasing both the interpretability and the accuracy of networks' decisions. Nonetheless, these camera-based networks reason in camera view where scale is not homogeneous and hence not directly suitable for motion forecasting. In this paper, we introduce a novel monocular camera-only holistic end-to-end trajectory planning network with a Bird-Eye-View (BEV) intermediate representation that comes in the form of binary Occupancy Grid Maps (OGMs). To ease the prediction of OGMs in BEV from camera images, we introduce a novel scheme where the OGMs are first predicted as semantic masks in camera view and then warped in BEV using the homography between the two planes.

In particular, deep spiking neural networks (SNNs) have gained interest because their event-driven hardware implementations can consume very low energy. However, minimizing average spiking activity and thus energy consumption while preserving accuracy in deep SNNs remains a significant challenge and opportunity. This paper proposes a novel two-step SNN compression technique to reduce their spiking activity while maintaining accuracy that involves compressing specifically-designed artificial neural networks (ANNs) that are then converted into the target SNNs. Our approach uses an ultra-high ANN compression technique that is guided by the attention-maps of an uncompressed meta-model. We then evaluate the firing threshold of each ANN layer and start with the trained ANN weights to perform a sparse-learning-based supervised SNN training to minimize the number of timesteps required while retaining compression. To evaluate the merits of the proposed approach, we performed experiments with variants of VGG and ResNet, on both CIFAR-10and CIFAR-100, and VGG16 on Tiny-ImageNet.

An algorithm can learn to find answers to the prediction task yet not perform generalizable reasoning. In other words, models can leverage ""shortcuts"" between inputs and desired outputs, to bypass the need for reasoning.

Domain-Aware Unsupervised Hyperspectral Reconstruction for Aerial Image Dehazing,"Aditya Mehta, Harsh Sinha, Murari Mandal, Pratik Narang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 413-422","Haze removal in aerial images is a challenging problem due to considerable variation in spatial details and varying contrast. Changes in particulate matter density often lead to degradation in visibility. Therefore, several approaches utilize multi-spectral data as auxiliary information for haze removal. In this paper, we propose SkyGAN for haze removal in aerial images. SkyGAN comprises of 1) a domain-aware hazy-to-hyperspectral (H2H) module, and 2) a conditional GAN (cGAN) based multi-cue image-to-image translation module (I2I) for dehazing. The proposed H2H module reconstructs several visual bands from RGB images in an unsupervised manner, which overcomes the lack of hazy hyperspectral aerial image datasets. The module utilizes task supervision and domain adaptation in order to create a ""hyperspectral catalyst"" for image dehazing. The I2I module uses the hyperspectral catalyst along with a 12-channel multi-cue input and performs effective image dehazing by utilizing the entire visual spectrum. In addition, this work introduces a new dataset, called Hazy Aerial-Image (HAI) dataset, that contains more than 65,000 pairs of hazy and ground truth aerial images with realistic, non-homogeneous haze of varying density. The performance of SkyGAN is evaluated on the recent SateHaze1k dataset as well as the HAI dataset.

Second, the learned deep representations are cross-modulated to the latent encoding of the alternate domain. The consistency between the reconstruction from the modulated latent encoding and the generation using deep representation samples is then enforced in order to produce inter-class alignment in the latent space further.

Previous research has shown that points' sparsity, rotation and positional inherent variance can lead to a significant drop in the performance of point cloud based classification techniques.

We propose a self-supervised approach (LT-GAN) to improve the generation quality and diversity of images by estimating the GAN-induced transformation (i.e. transformation induced in the generated images by perturbing the latent space of generator). Specifically, given two pairs of images where each pair comprises of a generated image and its transformed version, the self-supervision task aims to identify whether the latent transformation applied in the given pair is same as that of the other pair. Hence, this auxiliary loss encourages the generator to produce images that are distinguishable by the auxiliary network, which in turn promotes the synthesis of semantically consistent images with respect to latent transformations. We show the efficacy of this pretext task by improving the image generation quality in terms of FID on state-of-the-art models in conditional and unconditional settings on CIFAR-10, CelebA-HQ and ImageNet datasets. Moreover, we empirically show that LT-GAN helps in improving controlled image editing for CelebA-HQ, and ImageNet over baseline models.

Phase-Wise Parameter Aggregation for Improving SGD Optimization,Takumi Kobayashi," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 2625-2634","Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is successfully applied to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on various computer vision tasks. Since fixed step-size SGD converges to so-called error plateau, it is applied in combination with decaying learning rate to reach a favorable optimum. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective optimization method to improve SGD with a phase-wise decay of learning rate. Through analyzing both a loss surface around the error plateau and a structure of the SGD optimization process, the proposed method is formulated to improve convergence as well as initialization at each training phase by efficiently aggregating the CNN parameters along the optimization sequence. The method keeps the simplicity of SGD while touching the SGD procedure only a few times during training.

In many tasks, however, satisfying these requirements can be a formidable challenge. In this paper, we contend that histopathology image classification is a compelling use case for curriculum learning. Based on the nature of histopathology images, a range of difficulty inherently exists among examples, and, since medical datasets are often labeled by multiple annotators, annotator agreement can be used as a natural proxy for the difficulty of a given example. Hence, we propose a simple curriculum learning method that trains on progressively-harder images as determined by annotator agreement. We evaluate our hypothesis on the challenging and clinically-important task of colorectal polyp classification. Whereas vanilla training achieves an AUC of 83.7% for this task, a model trained with our proposed curriculum learning approach achieves an AUC of 88.2%, an improvement of 4.5%.

Our method exploits the availability of identical sceneries under different illumination and environmental conditions for which we formulate a partially impossible reconstruction target: the input image will not convey enough information to reconstruct the target in its entirety. Its applicability is assessed on three publicly available datasets. We combine the triplet loss as a regularizer in the latent space representation and a nearest neighbour search to improve the generalization to unseen illuminations and class instances. The importance of the aforementioned post-processing is highlighted on an automotive application.

Among these processing steps, local tone mapping is one of the most important operations used to enhance the overall appearance of the final rendered sRGB image. For certain applications, it is often desirable to de-render or unprocess the sRGB image back to its original raw-RGB values. This ""raw reconstruction"" is a challenging task because many of the operations performed by the ISP, including local tone mapping, are nonlinear and difficult to invert. Existing raw reconstruction methods that store specialized metadata at capture time to enable raw recovery ignore local tone mapping and assume that a global transformation exists between the raw-RGB and sRGB color spaces. In this work, we advocate a spatially aware metadata-based raw reconstruction method that is robust to local tone mapping, and yields significantly higher raw reconstruction accuracy (6 dB average PSNR improvement) compared to existing raw reconstruction methods. Our method requires only 0.2% samples of the full-sized image as metadata, has negligible computational overhead at capture time, and can be easily integrated into modern ISPs.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Punnappurath_Spatially_Aware_Metadata_for_Raw_Reconstruction_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

We consider learning in isolation, using one-hot encoded labels as the sole source of supervision, and a lack of regularization to discourage memorization as the major shortcomings of the standard training procedure. Thus, we propose Noisy Concurrent Training (NCT) which leverages collaborative learning to use the consensus between two models as an additional source of supervision. Furthermore, inspired by trial-to-trial variability in the brain, we propose a counterintuitive regularization technique, target variability, which entails randomly changing the labels of a percentage of training samples in each batch as a deterrent to memorization and overgeneralization in DNNs. Target variability is applied independently to each model to keep them diverged and avoid the confirmation bias. As DNNs tend to prioritize learning simple patterns first before memorizing the noisy labels, we employ a dynamic learning scheme whereby as the training progresses, the two models increasingly rely more on their consensus. NCT also progressively increases the target variability to avoid memorization in later stages.

Our experiments demonstrate that RGPNet can generate segmentation results in real-time with comparable accuracy to the state-of-the-art non-real-time heavy models.

We consider the scenario where supervision is available for a pair of tasks in a source domain while it is available for only one of the tasks in the target domain. Given that, the goal is to perform inference for the task in the target which is devoid of any training information. We argue that the only reported work in learning across tasks and domains (AT/DT) [23] faces the problem of domain shift between the source and target domains, hindering predictions on the target domain when the transfer of knowledge is learned on a statistically different yet related source domain. As a remedy, we develop a novel framework called ADA-AT/DT based on the adversarial training strategy to ensure that the domain-gaps are minimized for the common cross-domain supervised task. This, in effect, helps in realizing a domain-independent task-transfer function that eventually helps in performing improved inference in the target domain. We demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms [23] by using models with 81% fewer trainable parameters. In addition, we perform experiments on a transformation mapping similar to U-Net to ensure maximum exploitation of features for task transfer.

To overcome this limitation, we introduce the Class Anchor Clustering (CAC) loss. CAC is a distance-based loss that explicitly trains known classes to form tight clusters around anchored class-dependent centres in the logit space. We show that training with CAC achieves state-of-the-art performance for distance-based open set classifiers on all six standard benchmark datasets, with a 15.2% AUROC increase on the challenging TinyImageNet, without sacrificing classification accuracy.

These models allow to simultaneously classify images and extract class-dependent saliency maps, without the need for costly pixel-level annotations. However, they typically yield segmentations with high false-positive rates and, therefore, coarse visualisations, more so when processing challenging images, as encountered in histology. To mitigate this issue, we propose an active learning (AL) framework, which progressively integrates pixel-level annotations during training. Given training data with global image-level labels, our deep weakly-supervised learning model jointly performs supervised image-level classification and active learning for segmentation, integrating pixel annotations by an oracle.

Specifically, given pretrained object feature extraction networks that serve as teachers, we train a student network to infer compatible foreground features from background images. Thus, foregrounds and backgrounds are effectively mapped into a common feature space, enabling retrieval of the foregrounds that are closest to the target background in that space. A notable feature of our approach is that our training strategy does not require instance segmentation, unlike current state-of-the-art methods.

Most state-of-the-art localization approaches assume static scenes, so maps are often reconstructed once and then kept constant. However, many scenes are dynamic and as changes in the scene happen, future localization attempts may struggle or fail entirely. Therefore, it is important for successful long-term localization to update and maintain maps as new observations of the scene, and changes in it, arrive. We propose a novel method for automatically discovering which points in a map remain stable over time, and which are due to transient changes. To this end, we calculate a stability store for each point based on its visibility over time, weighted by an exponential decay over time. This allows us to introduce the impact of time when scoring points, and distinguishes which points are useful for long-term localization. We evaluate our method on the CMU Extended Seasons dataset (outdoors) and a new indoor dataset of a retail shop, and show the benefit of maintaining a `live map' that integrates updates over time using our exponential decay based method over a static `base map'.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Rotsidis_ExMaps_Long-Term_Localization_in_Dynamic_Scenes_Using_Exponential_Decay_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

However, if the identity differs, the driving facial structures leak to the output distorting the reenactment result. We propose a novel Facial Attribute Controllable rEenactment GAN (FACEGAN), which transfers the facial motion from the driving face via the Action Unit (AU) representation.

Namboodiri"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 2654-2663","In this paper, we propose an approach to improve few-shot classification performance using a composite rotation based auxiliary task. Few-shot classification methods aim to produce neural networks that perform well for classes with a large number of training samples and classes with less number of training samples. They employ techniques to enable the network to produce highly discriminative features that are also very generic. Generally, the better the quality and generic-nature of the features produced by the network, the better is the performance of the network on few-shot learning. Our approach aims to train networks to produce such features by using a self-supervised auxiliary task. Our proposed composite rotation based auxiliary task performs rotation at two levels, i.e., rotation of patches inside the image (inner rotation) and rotation of the whole image (outer rotation) and assigns one out of 16 rotation classes to the modified image. We then simultaneously train for the composite rotation prediction task along with the original classification task, which forces the network to learn high-quality generic features that help improve the few-shot classification performance. We experimentally show that our approach performs better than existing few-shot learning methods on multiple benchmark datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Mazumder_Improving_Few-Shot_Learning_Using_Composite_Rotation_Based_Auxiliary_Task_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV
Covariance-Free Partial Least Squares: An Incremental Dimensionality Reduction Method,"Artur Jordao, Maiko Lie, Victor Hugo Cunha de Melo, William Robson Schwartz"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 1421-1429","Dimensionality reduction plays an important role in computer vision problems since it reduces computational cost and is often capable of yielding more discriminative data representation. In this context, Partial Least Squares (PLS) has presented notable results in tasks such as image classification and neural network optimization. However, PLS is infeasible on large datasets (e.g., ImageNet) because it requires all the data to be in memory in advance, which is often impractical due to hardware limitations. Additionally, this requirement prevents us from employing PLS on streaming applications where the data are being continuously generated. Motivated by this, we propose a novel incremental PLS, named Covariance-free Incremental Partial Least Squares (CIPLS), which learns a low-dimensional representation of the data using a single sample at a time. In contrast to other state-of-the-art approaches, instead of adopting a partially-discriminative or SGD-based model, we extend Nonlinear Iterative Partial Least Squares (NIPALS) -- the standard algorithm used to compute PLS -- for incremental processing. Among the advantages of this approach are the preservation of discriminative information across all components, the possibility of employing its score matrices for feature selection, and its computational efficiency. We validate CIPLS on face verification and image classification tasks, where it outperforms several other incremental dimensionality reduction methods. In the context of feature selection, CIPLS achieves comparable results when compared to state-of-the-art techniques.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Jordao_Covariance-Free_Partial_Least_Squares_An_Incremental_Dimensionality_Reduction_Method_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

To address these limitations we introduce OverNet, a deep but lightweight convolutional network to solve SISR at arbitrary scale factors with a single model. We make the following contributions: first, we introduce a lightweight feature extractor that enforces efficient reuse of information through a novel recursive structure of skip and dense connections. Second, to maximize the performance of the feature extractor, we propose a model agnostic reconstruction module that generates accurate high-resolution images from overscaled feature maps obtained from any SR architecture.

Previous works have presented deep neural network models for predictions using a detailed prior map which includes driving lanes and explicitly expresses the road rules like legal traffic directions and valid paths through intersections. Since it is unrealistic to assume the existence of the detailed prior maps for all areas, we use a map generated from only perceptual data (3D points measured by a LiDAR sensor). Such maps do not explicitly denote road rules, which makes prediction tasks more difficult. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) based framework. A discriminator in our framework can distinguish whether predicted trajectories follow road rules, and a generator can predict trajectories following it. Our framework implicitly extracts road rules by projecting trajectories onto the map via a differentiable function and training positional relations between trajectories and obstacles on the map. We also extend our framework to multimodal predictions so that various future trajectories are predicted.

The auxiliary branch is trained to generate the bold version of target characters which are then fed to the dominating branch to guide the stroke refinement. The two branches are jointly trained in a collaborative fashion. In addition, for practical use, it is desirable to train the character synthesis model with a small set of manually designed characters. Taking advantage of content-reuse phenomenon in Chinese characters, we further propose an online zoom-augmentation strategy to reduce the dependency on large size training sets. The proposed model is trained end-to-end and can be added on top of any method for font synthesis.

Recently, this problem has been extended in a multimodal scenario, by exploiting both textual and visual features of ambiguous verbs leading to a new problem, the Visual Verb Sense Disambiguation (VVSD). Here, the sense of a verb is assigned considering the content of an image paired with it rather than a sentence in which the verb appears. Annotating a dataset for this task is more complex than textual disambiguation, because assigning the correct sense to a pair of <image, verb> requires both non-trivial linguistic and visual skills. In this work, differently from the literature, the VVSD task will be performed in a transductive semi-supervised learning (SSL) setting, in which only a small amount of labeled information is required, reducing tremendously the need for annotated data.

Existing methods to resolve the problem involve re-sampling, re-weighting, or cost-sensitive learning. Most of them anticipate that emphasizing the minority classes during the training would help the network to learn better representations. In this paper, we propose a method for reparameterizing softmax classifiers' offsets so that training is less sensitive to class imbalance. We first observe that the trained offset of the baseline linear classifier is biased toward the majority classes due to the imbalance. Instead of the trained offset, we define the estimated offset, and constrain it to be uniform over the classes. In experiments with long-tailed benchmarks, our method exhibits the best performance.

Oriented Object Detection in Aerial Images With Box Boundary-Aware Vectors,"Jingru Yi, Pengxiang Wu, Bo Liu, Qiaoying Huang, Hui Qu, Dimitris Metaxas"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 2150-2159","Oriented object detection in aerial images is a challenging task as the objects in aerial images are displayed in arbitrary directions and are usually densely packed. Current oriented object detection methods mainly rely on two-stage anchor-based detectors. However, the anchor-based detectors typically suffer from a severe imbalance issue between the positive and negative anchor boxes. To address this issue, in this work we extend the horizontal keypoint-based object detector to the oriented object detection task. In particular, we first detect the center keypoints of the objects, based on which we then regress the box boundary-aware vectors (BBAVectors) to capture the oriented bounding boxes. The box boundary-aware vectors are distributed in the four quadrants of a Cartesian coordinate system for all arbitrarily oriented objects. To relieve the difficulty of learning the vectors in the corner cases, we further classify the oriented bounding boxes into horizontal and rotational bounding boxes. In the experiment, we show that learning the box boundary-aware vectors is superior to directly predicting the width, height, and angle of an oriented bounding box, as adopted in the baseline method. Besides, the proposed method competes favorably with state-of-the-art methods.

First, we quantify the number of mistakes made. Our results show that (i) mistakes on background are substantial and they are responsible for 18-49% of the total error, (ii) models do not generalize well to different kinds of backgrounds and perform poorly on completely background images, and (iii) models make many more mistakes than those captured by the standard Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric, as counting on background compensates substantially for misses on foreground.

Our framework is motivated by two observations: 1) Videos provide richer information for estimating 3D poses as opposed to static images; 2) Estimated 3D poses ought to be consistent whether the videos are viewed in the forward order or reverse order. We leverage these two observations to develop a self-supervised learning model called temporal-aware self-supervised network (TASSN).By enforcing temporal consistency constraints, TASSN learns 3D hand poses and meshes from videos with only 2D keypoint position annotations.

This work proposes to bridge this gap by explicitly incorporating external knowledge for saliency models as humans do. We develop networks that learn to highlight regions by incorporating prior knowledge of semantic relationships, be it general or domain-specific, depending on the task of interest. At the core of the method is a new GraSSNet that constructs a graph that encodes semantic relationships learned from external knowledge.

Existing methods concentrate on learning four vertices to construct the contour. However, vertices are dummy intersections entangled by their neighbor sides. The regression of each vertex would simultaneously affect its two neighbor sides. As a result, the originally independent side would be influenced by two different vertices which further inevitably disturb other sides. The above entangled vertices learning suppresses the learning efficiency and detection performance. In this paper, we proposed disentangled contour learning network (DCLNet) to focus on clear regression of each individual side disentangled from the whole quadrilateral contour. The side is parameterized by a linear equation that disentangled in the polar coordinates for easier learning. With tailored Ray-IoU loss and sine angle loss, DCLNet could better learn the representation of each disentangled side without being disturbed by others. The final quadrilateral text contour is easily constructed by intersecting the predicted linear equations of sides.

Further, it is not possible to manually interact with these algorithms in any way except by directly changing their input or output. We propose a novel recurrent neural network that can be used as a post-processing method to recover the foreground and background colors of an image, given an initial alpha estimation. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art in color estimation for natural image matting and show that the recurrent nature of our method allows users to easily change candidate solutions that lead to superior color estimations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Lutz_Foreground_Color_Prediction_Through_Inverse_Compositing_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

A very encouraging result of our study is that adding a manually annotated mask in only a single video frame for each object is sufficient to generate pseudo-labels which can be used to train a VOS method to reach almost the same performance level as when training with fully segmented videos. We use this workflow to create pixel pseudo-labels for the training set of the challenging tracking dataset TAO, and we manually annotate a subset of the validation set.

In this work, we generate style consistent histopathology images for nuclei instance segmentation. We set up a novel instance segmentation framework that integrates a generator and discriminator into the segmentation pipeline with adversarial training to generalize nuclei instances and texture patterns.

It mainly focuses on matching high-frequency parts of noisy images through discrete wavelet transform (DWT) since they include most of noise statistics.

However, this assumption is often invalid, especially when it comes to fine-grained recognition. In this work, we define a new FSL setting termed scarce-source few-shot learning (SSFSL), under which both the source and target classes have limited training samples. To overcome the source class data scarcity problem, a natural option is to crawl images from the web with class names as search keywords. However, the crawled images are inevitably corrupted by large amount of noise (irrelevant images) and thus may harm the performance. To address this problem, we propose a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based label denoising (LDN) method to remove the irrelevant images. Further, with the cleaned web images as well as the original clean training images, we propose a GCN-based FSL method. For both the LDN and FSL tasks, a novel adaptive aggregation GCN (AdarGCN) model is proposed, which differs from existing GCN models in that adaptive aggregation is performed based on a multi-head multi-level aggregation module. With AdarGCN, how much and how far information carried by each graph node is propagated in the graph structure can be determined automatically, therefore alleviating the effects of both noisy and outlying training samples.

We address two potential issues existed in current head pose estimation works: 1. Public datasets for head pose estimation use either Euler angles or quaternions to annotate data samples. However, both of these annotations have the issue of discontinuity and thus could result in some performance issues in neural network training. 2. Most research works report Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of Euler angles as the measurement of performance. We show that MAE may not reflect the actual behavior especially for the cases of profile views. To solve these two problems, we propose a new annotation method which uses three vectors to describe head poses and a new measurement Mean Absolute Error of Vectors (MAEV) to assess the performance. We also train a new neural network to predict the three vectors with the constraints of orthogonality. Our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on both AFLW2000 and BIWI datasets.

Boult"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 1984-1993","Image classification in the open-world must handle out-of-distribution (OOD) images. Systems should ideally reject OOD images, or they will map atop of known classes and reduce reliability. Using open-set classifiers that can reject OOD inputs can help. However, optimal accuracy of open-set classifiers depend on the frequency of OOD data. Thus, for either standard or open-set classifiers, it is important to be able to determine when the world changes and increasing OOD inputs will result in reduced system reliability. However, during operations, we cannot directly assess accuracy as there are no labels. Thus, the reliability assessment of these classifiers must be done by human operators, made more complex because networks are not 100% accurate, so some failures are to be expected. To automate this process, herein, we formalize the open-world recognition reliability problem and propose multiple automatic reliability assessment policies to address this new problem using only the distribution of reported scores/probability data.

Recently, efforts to train machines to mimic this ability of humans in the form of weakly supervised object localization, using training labels only at the image-level, have garnered a lot of attention. Nonetheless, one of the well-known problems that most of the existing methods suffer from is localizing only the most discriminative part of an object. Such methods provide very little or no focus on other pertinent parts of the object. In this paper, we propose a novel way of scrupulously localizing objects using training with labels as for the entire image by mining information from complementary regions in an image. Primarily, we adapt to regional dropout at complementary spatial locations to create two intermediate images. With the help of a novel Channel-wise Assisted Attention Module (CAAM) coupled with a Spatial Self-Attention Module (SSAM), we parallely train our model to leverage the information from complementary image regions for excellent localization. Finally, we fuse the attention maps generated by the two classifiers using our Attention-based Fusion Loss. Several experimental studies manifest the superior performance of our proposed approach.

With the rapid development of social networks and mobile devices, food images captured by people can offer rich knowledge about the food and also necessary dietary assistance for people that require special care. Known food recognition frameworks and approaches in computer vision have heavy reliance on many-shot training of a deep network on existing large-scale food datasets. However, it is common for many food categories that it is difficult to collect enough images for training. Traditional few-shot learning is unable to properly address the problem due to the complex characteristics and large variations of food images, and most few-shot frameworks cannot perform classification for many-shot and few-shot categories at the same time. In this paper, we propose a new fusion learning framework for food recognition. It unifies many-shot and few-shot under a single framework, by leveraging on extracted image representations and context sensitive semantic embeddings.

Exploiting Spatial Relation for Reducing Distortion in Style Transfer,"Jia-Ren Chang, Yong-Sheng Chen"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 1209-1217","The power of convolutional neural networks in arbitrary style transfer has been amply demonstrated; however, existing stylization methods tend to generate spatially inconsistent results with noticeable artifacts. One solution to this problem involves the application of a segmentation mask or affinity-based image matting to preserve spatial information related to image content. The main idea of this work is to model spatial relation between content image pixels and thus to maintain this relationship in stylization for reducing artifacts. The proposed network architecture is called spatial relation-augmented VGG (SRVGG), in which long-range spatial dependency is modeled by a spatial relation module. Based on this spatial information extracted from SRVGG, we design a novel relation loss which can minimize the difference of spatial dependency between content images and stylizations. We evaluate the proposed framework on both optimization-based and feedforward-based style transfer methods. The effectiveness of SRVGG in stylization is demonstrated by generating stylized images of high quality and spatial consistency without the need for segmentation masks or affinity-based image matting. The quantitative evaluation also suggests that the proposed framework achieve better performance compared with other methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Chang_Exploiting_Spatial_Relation_for_Reducing_Distortion_in_Style_Transfer_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

This method uses undercomplete representations of the input data which makes it not so robust and more dependent on pre-training. To overcome this, we propose a simple yet efficient alternative method - Overcomplete Deep Subspace Clustering Networks (ODSC) where we use overcomplete representations for subspace clustering. In our proposed method, we fuse the features from both undercomplete and overcomplete auto-encoder networks before passing them through the self-expressive layer thus enabling us to extract a more meaningful and robust representation of the input data for clustering. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed method over DSC and other clustering methods in terms of clustering error.

Unfortunately, most documents are stored and distributed as PDF or scanned images, which fail to preserve table formatting. Recent vision-based deep learning approaches have been proposed to address this gap, but most still cannot achieve state-of-the-art results. We present Global Table Extractor (GTE), a vision-guided systematic framework for joint table detection and cell structured recognition, which could be built on top of any object detection model. With GTE-Table, we invent a new penalty based on the natural cell containment constraint of tables to train our table network aided by cell location predictions. GTE-Cell is a new hierarchical cell detection network that leverages table styles. Further, we design a method to automatically label table and cell structure in existing documents to cheaply create a large corpus of training and test data. We use this to enhance PubTabNet with cell labels and create FinTabNet, real-world and complex scientific and financial datasets with detailed table structure annotations to help train and test structure recognition. Our deep learning framework surpasses previous state-of-the-art results on the ICDAR 2013 and ICDAR 2019 table competition test dataset in both table detection and cell structure recognition.

This results in three major challenges; large domain discrepancy between violence videos and ID-photos, the lack of video examples for most individuals and limited training data availability. To mimic such scenarios, we formulate a realistic domain-transfer problem, where the goal is to transfer the recognition model trained on clean posed images to the target domain of violent videos, where training videos are available only for a subset of subjects.

Each of these factors may cause serious problems for a tracker, and when they work together can make things even more complicated. Despite a great amount of efforts devoted to understanding the behavior of trackers, reliable and quantifiable ways for studying the per factor tracking behavior remain barely available. Addressing this issue, in this paper we contribute to the community a tracking diagnosis toolkit, TracKlinic, for diagnosis of challenge factors of tracking algorithms. TracKlinic consists of two novel components focusing on the data and analysis aspects, respectively. For the data component, we carefully prepare a set of 2,390 annotated videos, each involving one and only one major challenge factor. When analyzing an algorithm for a specific challenge factor, such one-factor-per-sequence rule greatly inhibits the disturbance from other factors and consequently leads to more faithful analysis. For the analysis component, given the tracking results on all sequences, it investigates the behavior of the tracker under each individual factor and generates the report automatically. With TracKlinic, a thorough study is conducted on ten state-of-the-art trackers on nine challenge factors (including two compound ones). The results suggest that, heavy shape variation and occlusion are the two most challenging factors faced by most trackers. Besides, out-of-view, though does not happen frequently, is often fatal.

Thus, having a system that automatically detects COVID-19 in tomography (CT) images can assist in quantifying the severity of the illness. Unfortunately, labelling chest CT scans requires significant domain expertise, time, and effort. We address these labelling challenges by only requiring point annotations, a single pixel for each infected region on a CT image. This labeling scheme allows annotators to label a pixel in a likely infected region, only taking 1-3 seconds, as opposed to 10-15 seconds to segment a region. Conventionally, segmentation models train on point-level annotations using the cross-entropy loss function on these labels. However, these models often suffer from low precision. Thus, we propose a consistency-based (CB) loss function that encourages the output predictions to be consistent with spatial transformations of the input images.

With such a flexible instantiation mechanism, the parameters of instance modules are inherited from the central meta module, retaining the same model complexity as the function set grows, which promises better scalability. Meanwhile, as functions are encoded into the embedding space, unseen functions can be readily represented based on its structural similarity with previously observed ones, which ensures better generalizability.

Most weakly-supervised learning methods do not make provision for leveraging data with strong supervision, when they are available; and indeed a naive combination of this two paradigms in HOI detection fails to make contributions to each other. In this regard we propose a mixed-supervised HOI detection pipeline: thanks to a specific design of momentum-independent learning, it learns seamlessly across these two types of supervision. Moreover, in light of the annotation insufficiency in mixed supervision, we introduce an HOI element swap-ping technique to synthesize diverse and hard negatives across images and improve the robustness of the model. Our method is evaluated on the challenging HICO-DET dataset. It outperforms the state of the art weakly- and fully-supervised methods under the same setting; and performs close to or even better than many fully-supervised methods by using a mixed amount of full and weak supervision.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Kumaraswamy_Detecting_Human-Object_Interaction_With_Mixed_Supervision_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV
Embedded Dense Camera Trajectories in Multi-Video Image Mosaics by Geodesic Interpolation-Based Reintegration,"Lars Haalck, Benjamin Risse"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 1849-1858","Dense registrations of huge image sets are still challenging due to exhaustive matchings and computationally expensive optimisations. Moreover, the resultant image mosaics often suffer from structural errors such as drift. Here, we propose a novel algorithm to generate global large-scale registrations from thousands of images extracted from multiple videos to derive high-resolution image mosaics which include full frame rate camera trajectories. Our algorithm does not require any initialisations and ensures the effective integration of all available image data by combining efficient and highly parallelised key-frame and loop-closure mechanisms with a novel geodesic interpolation-based reintegration strategy. As a consequence, global refinement can be done in a fraction of iterations compared to traditional optimisation strategies, while effectively avoiding drift and convergence towards inappropriate solutions. We compared our registration strategy with state-of-the-art algorithms and quantitative evaluations revealed millimetre spatial and high angular accuracy. Applicability is demonstrated by registering more than 110,000 frames from multiple scan recordings and provide dense camera trajectories in a globally referenced coordinate system as used for drone-based mappings, ecological studies, object tracking and land surveys.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Haalck_Embedded_Dense_Camera_Trajectories_in_Multi-Video_Image_Mosaics_by_Geodesic_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

However, deep learning models do not employ supervision for these attention mechanisms which can improve the model's performance significantly. Therefore, in this paper, we tackle this limitation and propose a novel method to improve the attention mechanism by inducing ""self-supervision"". We devise a technique to generate desirable attention maps for any model that utilizes an attention module. This is achieved by examining the model's output for different regions sampled from the input and obtaining the attention probability distributions that enhance the proficiency of the model. The attention distributions thus obtained are used for supervision. We rely on the fact, that attenuation of the unimportant parts, allows a model to attend to more salient regions, thus strengthening the prediction accuracy. The quantitative and qualitative results published in this paper show that this method successfully improves the attention mechanism as well as the model's accuracy. In addition to the task of Visual Question Answering(VQA), we also show results on the task of Image classification and Text classification to prove that our method can be generalized to any vision and language model that uses an attention module",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Patro_Self_Supervision_for_Attention_Networks_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

However, since some public datasets are captured from multi-view cameras system, we propose a novel method to tackle the problem by putting optimization-based multi-view model-fitting into a regression-based learning loop from multi-view images. Firstly, a convolutional neural network (CNN) regresses the pose and shape of a parametric human body model (SMPL) from multi-view images. Then, utilizing the regressed pose and shape as initialization, we propose an improved multi-view optimization method based on the SMPLify method (MV-SMPLify) to fit the SMPL model to the multi-view images simultaneously. Subsequently, the optimized parameters can be adopted to supervise the training of the CNN model. This whole process forms a self-supervising framework which can combine the advantages of the CNN approach and the optimization-based approach through a collaborative process.

In video understanding, temporal information is at the core of many current challenges, including compression, efficient inference, motion estimation or summarization. However, in current video datasets it has been observed that action classes can often be recognized without any temporal information, from a single frame of video. As a result, both benchmarking and training in these datasets may give an unintentional advantage to models with strong image understanding capabilities, as opposed to those with strong temporal understanding, potentially hindering progress. In this paper we address this problem head on by identifying action classes where temporal information is actually necessary to recognize them and call these ""temporal classes"". Selecting temporal classes using a computational method would bias the process. Instead, we propose a methodology based on a simple and effective human annotation experiment. We remove just the temporal information, by shuffling frames in time, and measure if the action can still be recognized. Classes that cannot be recognized when frames are not in order, are included in the temporal set. We observe that this set is statistically different from other static classes, and that performance in it correlates with a network's ability to capture temporal information. Thus we use it as a benchmark on current popular networks, which reveals a series of interesting facts, like inflated convolutions bias networks towards classes where motion is not important. We also explore the effect of training on the temporal set, and observe that this leads to better generalization in unseen classes, demonstrating the need for more temporal data.

However, for real-world low-resolution images (e.g. images captured straight from the camera) they often generate blurry images and highlight unpleasant artifacts. The main reason is the training data that does not reflect the real-world super-resolution problem. They train the network using images downsampled with an ideal (usually bicubic) kernel. However, for real-world images the degradation process is more complex and can vary from image to image. This paper proposes a new dual-path architecture (DualSR) that learns an image-specific low-to-high resolution mapping using only patches of the input test image. For every image, a downsampler learns the degradation process using a generative adversarial network, and an upsampler learns to super-resolve that specific image. In the DualSR architecture, the upsampler and downsampler are trained simultaneously and they improve each other using cycle consistency losses. For better visual quality and eliminating undesired artifacts, the upsampler is constrained by a masked interpolation loss. On standard benchmarks with unknown degradation kernels, DualSR outperforms recent blind and non-blind super-resolution methods in term of SSIM and generates images with higher perceptual quality.

Deep Metric Learning (DML) approaches such as center loss and its variants jointly optimized with softmax loss have been adopted in many FER methods to enhance the discriminative power of learned features in the embedding space. However, equally supervising all features with the metric learning method might include irrelevant features and ultimately degrade the generalization ability of the learning algorithm. We propose a Deep Attentive Center Loss (DACL) method to adaptively select a subset of significant feature elements for enhanced discrimination. The proposed DACL integrates an attention mechanism to estimate attention weights correlated with feature importance using the intermediate spatial feature maps in CNN as context.

Driver's activities are different since they are executed by the same subject with similar body parts movements, resulting in subtle changes. To address this, we propose a novel framework by exploiting the spatiotemporal attention to model the subtle changes. Our model is named Coarse Temporal Attention Network (CTA-Net), in which coarse temporal branches are introduced in a trainable glimpse network. The goal is to allow the glimpse to capture high-level temporal relationships, such as 'during', 'before' and 'after' by focusing on a specific part of a video. These branches also respect the topology of the temporal dynamics in the video, ensuring that different branches learn meaningful spatial and temporal changes. The model then uses an innovative attention mechanism to generate high-level action specific contextual information for activity recognition by exploring the hidden states of an LSTM. The attention mechanism helps in learning to decide the importance of each hidden state for the recognition task by weighing them when constructing the representation of the video.

The key to solving this few-shot segmentation problem lies in effectively utilizing object information from support examples to separate target objects from the background in a query image. While existing methods typically generate object-level representations by averaging local features in support images, we demonstrate that such object representations are typically noisy and less distinguishing. To solve this problem, we design an object representation generator (ORG) module which can effectively aggregate local object features from support image(s) and produce better object-level representation. The ORG module can be embedded into the network and trained end-to-end in a weakly-supervised fashion without extra human annotation.

Perceptual differences may explain why CNNs achieve human-level performance when large labeled datasets are available, but their performance significantly degrades in low-labeled data scenarios, such as few-shot semantic segmentation.

One problem here is that this task usually requires a large amount of hand-annotated minute- or even hour-long video data, but annotating such data is very time consuming and can not easily be automated or scaled. To address this problem, this paper proposes an approach for the unsupervised learning of actions in untrimmed video sequences based on a joint visual-temporal embedding space. To this end, we combine a visual embedding based on a predictive U-Net architecture with a temporal continuous function. The resulting representation space allows detecting relevant action clusters based on their visual as well as their temporal appearance. The proposed method is evaluated on three standard benchmark datasets, Breakfast Actions, INRIA YouTube Instructional Videos, and 50 Salads. We show that the proposed approach is able to provide a meaningful visual and temporal embedding out of the visual cues present in contiguous video frames and is suitable for the task of unsupervised temporal segmentation of actions.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/VidalMata_Joint_Visual-Temporal_Embedding_for_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Actions_in_Untrimmed_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

Losses that are theoretically robust to label noise, however, often makes training difficult. Consequently, several recently proposed methods, such as Meta-Weight-Net (MW-Net), use a small number of unbiased, clean samples to learn a weighting function that downweights samples that are likely to have corrupted labels under the meta-learning framework. However, obtaining such a set of clean samples is not always feasible in practice. In this paper, we analytically show that one can easily train MW-Net without access to clean samples simply by using a loss function that is robust to label noise, such as mean absolute error, as the meta objective to train the weighting network.

We propose a new model to use key-point guidance for segmenting parts of novel object classes given that they have similar structures as seen objects --different types of four-legged animals, for example. We show that a non-parametric template matching approach is more effective than pixel classification for part segmentation, especially for small or less frequent parts. To evaluate the generalizability of our approach, we introduce two new datasets that contain 200 quadrupeds in total with both key-point and part segmentation annotations.

This is because mixing random image contents may potentially produce images containing destructed object structures. Further, as the category differences mainly reside in small part regions, mixing labels proportionally to the number of mixed pixels might result in label noisy problem. To augment more reasonable training data, we propose Intra-class Part Swapping (InPS) that produces new data by performing attention-guided content swapping on input pairs from the same class. Compared with previous approaches, InPS avoids introducing noisy labels and ensures a likely holistic structure of objects in generated images. We demonstrate InPS outperforms the most recent augmentation approaches in both fine-grained recognition and weakly object localization.

However, most current methods still have difficulties with handling tiny details, like hairs or furs. In this paper, we argue that recovering these microscopic details relies on low-level but high-definition texture features. However, these features are downsampled in a very early stage in current encoder-decoder-based models, resulting in the loss of microscopic details . To address this issue, we design a deep image matting model to enhance fine-grained details. Our model consists of two parallel paths: a conventional encoder-decoder Semantic Path and an independent downsampling-free Textural Compensate Path (TCP). The TCP is proposed to extract fine-grained details such as lines and edges in the original image size, which greatly enhances the fineness of prediction. Meanwhile, to leverage the benefits of high-level context, we propose a feature fusion unit(FFU) to fuse multi-scale features from the semantic path and inject them into the TCP. In addition, we have observed that poorly annotated trimaps severely affect the performance of the model. Thus we further propose a novel term in loss function and a trimap generation method to improve our model's robustness to the trimaps.

A Learning-Based Approach to Parametric Rotoscoping of Multi-Shape Systems,"Luis Bermudez, Nadine Dabby, Yingxi Adelle Lin, Sara Hilmarsdottir, Narayan Sundararajan, Swarnendu Kar"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 776-785","Rotoscoping of facial features is often an integral part of Visual Effects post-production, where the parametric contours created by artists need to be highly detailed, consist of multiple interacting components, and involve significant manual supervision. Yet those assets are usually discarded after compositing and hardly reused. In this paper, we present the first methodology to learn from these assets. With only a few manually rotoscoped shots, we identify and extract semantically consistent and task specific landmark points and re-vectorize the roto shapes based on these landmarks. We then train two separate models -- one to predict landmarks based on a rough crop of the face region, and the other to predict the roto shapes using only the inferred landmarks from the first model. In preliminary production testing, 26% of shots rotoscoped using our tool were able to be used with no adjustment, and another 47% were able to be used with minor adjustments. This represents a significant time savings for the studio, as artists are able to rotoscope almost 73% of their shots with no manual rotoscoping and some spline adjustment. This paper presents a novel application of machine learning to professional interactive rotoscoping, a methodology to convert unstructured roto shapes into a self-annotated, trainable dataset that can be harnessed to make accurate predictions on future shots of a similar object, and a limited dataset of rotoscoped multi-shape fine feature systems from a real film production.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Bermudez_A_Learning-Based_Approach_to_Parametric_Rotoscoping_of_Multi-Shape_Systems_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV
Task-Assisted Domain Adaptation With Anchor Tasks,"Zhizhong Li, Linjie Luo, Sergey Tulyakov, Qieyun Dai, Derek Hoiem"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 2989-2998","Some tasks, such as surface normals or single-view depth estimation, require per-pixel ground truth that is difficult to obtain on real images but easy to obtain on synthetic. However, models learned on synthetic images often do not generalize well to real images due to the domain shift. Our key idea to improve domain adaptation is to introduce a separate anchor task (such as facial landmarks) whose annotations can be obtained at no cost or are already available on both synthetic and real datasets. To further leverage the implicit relationship between the anchor and main tasks, we apply our HeadFreeze technique that learns the cross-task guidance on the source domain with the final network layers, and use it on the target domain. We evaluate our methods on surface normal estimation on two pairs of datasets (indoor scenes and faces) with two kinds of anchor tasks (semantic segmentation and facial landmarks). We show that blindly applying domain adaptation or training the auxiliary task on only one domain may hurt performance, while using anchor tasks on both domains is better behaved. Our HeadFreeze technique outperforms competing approaches, reaching performance in facial images on par with a recently popular surface normal estimation method using shape from shading domain knowledge.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Li_Task-Assisted_Domain_Adaptation_With_Anchor_Tasks_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV
Towards Fair Cross-Domain Adaptation via Generative Learning,"Tongxin Wang, Zhengming Ding, Wei Shao, Haixu Tang, Kun Huang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 454-463","Domain Adaptation (DA) targets at adapting a model trained over the well-labeled source domain to the unlabeled target domain lying in different distributions. Existing DA normally assumes the well-labeled source domain is class-wise balanced, which means the size per source class is relatively similar. However, in real-world applications, labeled samples for some categories in the source domain could be extremely few due to the difficulty of data collection and annotation, which leads to decreasing performance over target domain on those few-shot categories. To perform fair cross-domain adaptation and boost the performance on these minority categories, we develop a novel Generative Few-shot Cross-domain Adaptation (GFCA) algorithm for fair cross-domain classification. Specifically, generative feature augmentation is explored to synthesize effective training data for few-shot source classes, while effective cross-domain alignment aims to adapt knowledge from source to facilitate the target learning.

Neuron Matching in C. elegans With Robust Approximate Linear Regression Without Correspondence,"Amin Nejatbakhsh, Erdem Varol"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 2837-2846",We propose methods for estimating correspondence between two point sets under the presence of outliers in both the source and target sets. The proposed algorithms expand upon the theory of the regression without correspondence problem to estimate transformation coefficients using unordered multisets of covariates and responses. Previous theoretical analysis of the problem has been done in a setting where the responses are a complete permutation of the regressed covariates. This paper expands the problem setting by analyzing the cases where only a subset of the responses is a permutation of the regressed covariates in addition to some covariates possibly being adversarial outliers. We term this problem robust regression without correspondence and provide several algorithms based on random sample consensus for exact and approximate recovery in a noiseless and noisy one-dimensional setting as well as an approximation algorithm for multiple dimensions. The theoretical guarantees of the algorithms are verified in simulated data. We demonstrate an important computational neuroscience application of the proposed framework by demonstrating its effectiveness in a Caenorhabditis elegans neuron matching problem where the presence of outliers in both the source and target nematodes is a natural tendency.,https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Nejatbakhsh_Neuron_Matching_in_C._elegans_With_Robust_Approximate_Linear_Regression_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

Instruments and sensors useful for flood detection are only available in low resolution, low latency satellites with region re-visit periods of up to 16 days, making flood alerting systems that use such satellites unreliable. This work presents H2O-Network, a self supervised deep learning method to segment floods from satellites and aerial imagery by bridging domain gap between low and high latency satellite and coarse-to-fine label refinement. H2O-Net learns to synthesize signals highly correlative with water presence as a domain adaptation step for semantic segmentation in high resolution satellite imagery. Our work also proposes a self-supervision mechanism, which does not require any hand annotation, used during training to generate high quality ground truth data. We demonstrate that H2O-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art semantic segmentation methods on satellite imagery by 10% and 12% pixel accuracy and mIoU respectively for the task of flood segmentation.

EvidentialMix: Learning With Combined Open-Set and Closed-Set Noisy Labels,"Ragav Sachdeva, Filipe R. Cordeiro, Vasileios Belagiannis, Ian Reid, Gustavo Carneiro"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 3607-3615","The efficacy of deep learning depends on large-scale data sets that have been carefully curated with reliable data acquisition and annotation processes. However, acquiring such large-scale data sets with precise annotations is very expensive and time-consuming, and the cheap alternatives often yield data sets that have noisy labels. The field has addressed this problem by focusing on training models under two types of label noise: 1) closed-set noise, where some training samples are incorrectly annotated to a training label other than their known true class; and 2) open-set noise, where the training set includes samples that possess a true class that is (strictly) not contained in the set of known training labels. In this work, we study a new variant of the noisy label problem that combines the open-set and closed-set noisy labels, and introduce a benchmark evaluation to assess the performance of training algorithms under this setup. We argue that such problem is more general and better reflects the noisy label scenarios in practice. Furthermore, we propose a novel algorithm, called EvidentialMix, that addresses this problem and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art methods for both closed-set and open-set noise on the proposed benchmark. Our results show that our method produces superior classification results and better feature representations than previous state-of-the-art methods.

Fast Kernelized Correlation Filter Without Boundary Effect,"Ming Tang, Linyu Zheng, Bin Yu, Jinqiao Wang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 2999-3008","In recent years, correlation filter based trackers (CF trackers) have attracted much attention from the vision community because of their top performance in both localization accuracy and efficiency. The society of visual tracking, however, still needs to deal with the following difficulty on CF trackers: avoiding or eliminating the boundary effect completely, in the meantime, exploiting non-linear kernels and running efficiently. In this paper, we propose a fast kernelized correlation filter without boundary effect (nBEKCF) to solve this problem. To avoid the boundary effect thoroughly, a set of real and dense patches is sampled through the traditional sliding window and used as the training samples to train nBEKCF to fit a Gaussian response map. Non-linear kernels can be applied naturally in nBEKCF due to its different theoretical foundation from the existing CF trackers'. To achieve the fast training and detection, a set of cyclic bases is introduced to construct the filter. Two algorithms, ACSII and CCIM, are developed to significantly accelerate the calculation of kernel correlation matrices. ACSII and CCIM fully exploit the density of training samples and cyclic structure of bases, and totally run in space domain. The efficiency of CCIM exceeds that of the FFT counterpart remarkably in our task. Extensive experiments on six public datasets, OTB-2013, OTB-2015, NfS, VOT2018, GOT10k, and TrackingNet, show that compared to the CF trackers designed to relax the boundary effect, BACF and SRDCF, our nBEKCF achieves higher localization accuracy without tricks, in the meanwhile, runs at higher FPS.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Tang_Fast_Kernelized_Correlation_Filter_Without_Boundary_Effect_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV
PDAN: Pyramid Dilated Attention Network for Action Detection,"Rui Dai, Srijan Das, Luca Minciullo, Lorenzo Garattoni, Gianpiero Francesca, Francois Bremond"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 2970-2979","Handling long and complex temporal information is an important factor for action detection tasks. This challenge is further aggravated by densely distributed actions in untrimmed videos. Previous action detection methods are failing in selecting the key temporal information in videos of long length. To this end, we introduce the Dilated Attention Layer (DAL). Compared to previous temporal convolution layer, DAL allocates attentional weights to each feature in the kernel, which enables DAL to learn better local representation across time. Furthermore, DAL when accompanied by dilated kernels is able to learn a global representation of several minutes long videos which is crucial for the task of action detection. Finally, we introduce Pyramid Dilated Attention Network (PDAN) which is build upon DAL. With the help of DAL combining with dilation and residual links, PDAN can model short-term and long-term temporal relations simultaneously by focusing on local segments at the level of low and high temporal receptive fields. This property enables PDAN to handle complex temporal relations between different action instances in long untrimmed videos. To corroborate the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method, we evaluate it on three densely annotated, multi-label datasets: MultiTHUMOS, Charades and an Inhouse dataset, outperforming the state-of-the-art results.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2021/html/Dai_PDAN_Pyramid_Dilated_Attention_Network_for_Action_Detection_WACV_2021_paper.html,2021,WACV

However, it is also improper to directly apply end-to-end deep learning solutions since these methods usually deal with specific types of charts. In this paper, we propose an unified method ChartOCR to extract data from various types of charts. We show that by combing deep framework and rule-based methods, we can achieve a satisfying generalization ability and obtain accurate and semantic-rich intermediate results. Our method extracts the key points that define the chart components. By adjusting the prior rules, the framework can be applied to different chart types. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with fast processing speed on two public datasets.

Unsupervised Multi-Target Domain Adaptation Through Knowledge Distillation,"Le Thanh Nguyen-Meidine, Atif Belal, Madhu Kiran, Jose Dolz, Louis-Antoine Blais-Morin, Eric Granger"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2021, pp. 1339-1347","Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) seeks to alleviate the problem of domain shift between the distribution of unlabeled data from the target domain w.r.t. labeled data from the source domain. While the single-target UDA scenario is well studied in the literature, Multi-Target Domain Adaptation (MTDA) remains largely unexplored despite its practical importance, e.g., in multi-camera video-surveillance applications. The MTDA problem can be addressed by adapting one specialized model per target domain, although this solution is too costly in many real-world applications. Blending multiple targets for MTDA has been proposed, yet this solution may lead to a reduction in model specificity and accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised MTDA approach to train a CNN that can generalize well across multiple target domains. Our Multi-Teacher MTDA (MT-MTDA) method relies on multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD) to iteratively distill target domain knowledge from multiple teachers to a common student. The KD process is performed in a progressive manner, where the student is trained by each teacher on how to perform UDA for a specific target, instead of directly learning domain adapted features. Finally, instead of combining the knowledge from each teacher, MT-MTDA alternates between teachers that distill knowledge, thereby preserving the specificity of each target (teacher) when learning to adapt to the student. MT-MTDA is compared against state-of-the-art methods on several challenging UDA benchmarks, and empirical results show that our proposed model can provide a considerably higher level of accuracy across multiple target domains.
