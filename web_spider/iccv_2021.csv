AdaSGN: Adapting Joint Number and Model Size for Efficient Skeleton-Based Action Recognition,"Lei Shi, Yifan Zhang, Jian Cheng, Hanqing Lu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 13413-13422","Existing methods for skeleton-based action recognition mainly focus on improving the recognition accuracy, whereas the efficiency of the model is rarely considered. Recently, there are some works trying to speed up the skeleton modeling by designing light-weight modules. However, in addition to the model size, the amount of the data involved in the calculation is also an important factor for the running speed, especially for the skeleton data where most of the joints are redundant or non-informative to identify a specific skeleton.Besides, previous works usually employ one fix-sized model for all the samples regardless of the difficulty of recognition, which wastes computations for easy samples.To address these limitations, a novel approach, called AdaSGN, is proposed in this paper, which can reduce the computational cost of the inference process by adaptively controlling the input number of the joints of the skeleton on-the-fly. Moreover, it can also adaptively select the optimal model size for each sample to achieve a better trade-off between the accuracy and the efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments on three challenging datasets, namely, NTU-60, NTU-120 and SHREC, to verify the superiority of the proposed approach, where AdaSGN achieves comparable or even higher performance with much lower GFLOPs compared with the baseline method.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Shi_AdaSGN_Adapting_Joint_Number_and_Model_Size_for_Efficient_Skeleton-Based_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
C2N: Practical Generative Noise Modeling for Real-World Denoising,"Geonwoon Jang, Wooseok Lee, Sanghyun Son, Kyoung Mu Lee"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 2350-2359","Learning-based image denoising methods have been bounded to situations where well-aligned noisy and clean images are given, or samples are synthesized from predetermined noise models, e.g., Gaussian. While recent generative noise modeling methods aim to simulate the unknown distribution of real-world noise, several limitations still exist. In a practical scenario, a noise generator should learn to simulate the general and complex noise distribution without using paired noisy and clean images. However, since existing methods are constructed on the unrealistic assumption of real-world noise, they tend to generate implausible patterns and cannot express complicated noise maps. Therefore, we introduce a Clean-to-Noisy image generation framework, namely C2N, to imitate complex real-world noise without using any paired examples. We construct the noise generator in C2N accordingly with each component of real-world noise characteristics to express a wide range of noise accurately. Combined with our C2N, conventional denoising CNNs can be trained to outperform existing unsupervised methods on challenging real-world benchmarks by a large margin.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Jang_C2N_Practical_Generative_Noise_Modeling_for_Real-World_Denoising_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Continual Learning on Noisy Data Streams via Self-Purified Replay,"Chris Dongjoo Kim, Jinseo Jeong, Sangwoo Moon, Gunhee Kim"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 537-547","Continually learning in the real world must overcome many challenges, among which noisy labels are a common and inevitable issue. In this work, we present a replay-based continual learning framework that simultaneously addresses both catastrophic forgetting and noisy labels for the first time. Our solution is based on two observations; (i) forgetting can be mitigated even with noisy labels via self-supervised learning, and (ii) the purity of the replay buffer is crucial. Building on this regard, we propose two key components of our method: (i) a self-supervised replay technique named Self-Replay, which can circumvent erroneous training signals arising from noisy labeled data, and (ii) the Self-Centered filter that maintains a purified replay buffer via centrality-based stochastic graph ensembles. The empirical results on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and WebVision with real-world noise demonstrate that our framework can maintain a highly pure replay buffer amidst noisy streamed data while greatly outperforming the combinations of the state-of-the-art continual learning and noisy label learning methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Kim_Continual_Learning_on_Noisy_Data_Streams_via_Self-Purified_Replay_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
FOVEA: Foveated Image Magnification for Autonomous Navigation,"Chittesh Thavamani, Mengtian Li, Nicolas Cebron, Deva Ramanan"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 15539-15548","Efficient processing of high-resolution video streams is safety-critical for many robotics applications such as autonomous driving. Image downsampling is a commonly adopted technique to ensure the latency constraint is met. However, this naive approach greatly restricts an object detector's capability to identify small objects. In this paper, we propose an attentional approach that elastically magnifies certain regions while maintaining a small input canvas. The magnified regions are those that are believed to have a high probability of containing an object, whose signal can come from a dataset-wide prior or frame-level prior computed from recent object predictions. The magnification is implemented by a KDE-based mapping to transform the bounding boxes into warping parameters, which are then fed into an image sampler with anti-cropping regularization. The detector is then fed with the warped image and we apply a differentiable backward mapping to get bounding box outputs in the original space. Our regional magnification allows algorithms to make better use of high-resolution input without incurring the cost of high-resolution processing. On the autonomous driving datasets Argoverse-HD and BDD100K, we show our proposed method boosts the detection AP over standard Faster R-CNN, with and without finetuning. Additionally, building on top of the previous state-of-the-art in streaming detection, our method sets a new record for streaming AP on Argoverse-HD (from 17.8 to 23.0 on a GTX 1080 Ti GPU), suggesting that it has achieved a superior accuracy-latency tradeoff.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Thavamani_FOVEA_Foveated_Image_Magnification_for_Autonomous_Navigation_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
PlenOctrees for Real-Time Rendering of Neural Radiance Fields,"Alex Yu, Ruilong Li, Matthew Tancik, Hao Li, Ren Ng, Angjoo Kanazawa"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 5752-5761","We introduce a method to render Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in real time using PlenOctrees, an octree-based 3D representation which supports view-dependent effects. Our method can render 800x800 images at more than 150 FPS, which is over 3000 times faster than conventional NeRFs. We do so without sacrificing quality while preserving the ability of NeRFs to perform free-viewpoint rendering of scenes with arbitrary geometry and view-dependent effects. Real-time performance is achieved by pre-tabulating the NeRF into a PlenOctree. In order to preserve view-dependent effects such as specularities, we factorize the appearance via closed-form spherical basis functions. Specifically, we show that it is possible to train NeRFs to predict a spherical harmonic representation of radiance, removing the viewing direction as an input to the neural network. Furthermore, we show that PlenOctrees can be directly optimized to further minimize the reconstruction loss, which leads to equal or better quality compared to competing methods. Moreover, this octree optimization step can be used to reduce the training time, as we no longer need to wait for the NeRF training to converge fully. Our real-time neural rendering approach may potentially enable new applications such as 6-DOF industrial and product visualizations, as well as next generation AR/VR systems.

Entropy Maximization and Meta Classification for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Semantic Segmentation,"Robin Chan, Matthias Rottmann, Hanno Gottschalk"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 5128-5137","Deep neural networks (DNNs) for the semantic segmentation of images are usually trained to operate on a predefined closed set of object classes. This is in contrast to the """"open world"""" setting where DNNs are envisioned to be deployed to. From a functional safety point of view, the ability to detect so-called """"out-of-distribution"""" (OoD) samples, i.e., objects outside of a DNN's semantic space, is crucial for many applications such as automated driving. A natural baseline approach to OoD detection is to threshold on the pixel-wise softmax entropy. We present a two-step procedure that significantly improves that approach. Firstly, we utilize samples from the COCO dataset as OoD proxy and introduce a second training objective to maximize the softmax entropy on these samples. Starting from pretrained semantic segmentation networks we re-train a number of DNNs on different in-distribution datasets and consistently observe improved OoD detection performance when evaluating on completely disjoint OoD datasets. Secondly, we perform a transparent post-processing step to discard false positive OoD samples by so-called """"meta classification"""". To this end, we apply linear models to a set of hand-crafted metrics derived from the DNN's softmax probabilities. In our experiments we consistently observe a clear additional gain in OoD detection performance, cutting down the number of detection errors by 52% when comparing the best baseline with our results. We achieve this improvement sacrificing only marginally in original segmentation performance. Therefore, our method contributes to safer DNNs with more reliable overall system performance.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Chan_Entropy_Maximization_and_Meta_Classification_for_Out-of-Distribution_Detection_in_Semantic_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Specificity-Preserving RGB-D Saliency Detection,"Tao Zhou, Huazhu Fu, Geng Chen, Yi Zhou, Deng-Ping Fan, Ling Shao"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 4681-4691","RGB-D saliency detection has attracted increasing attention, due to its effectiveness and the fact that depth cues can now be conveniently captured. Existing works often focus on learning a shared representation through various fusion strategies, with few methods explicitly considering how to preserve modality-specific characteristics. In this paper, taking a new perspective, we propose a specificity-preserving network for RGB-D saliency detection, which benefits saliency detection performance by exploring both the shared information and modality-specific properties (e.g., specificity). Specifically, two modality-specific networks and a shared learning network are adopted to generate individual and shared saliency maps. A cross-enhanced integration module (CIM) is proposed to fuse cross-modal features in the shared learning network, which are then propagated to the next layer for integrating cross-level information. Besides, we propose a multi-modal feature aggregation (MFA) module to integrate the modality-specific features from each individual decoder into the shared decoder, which can provide rich complementary multi-modal information to boost the saliency detection performance. Further, a skip connection is used to combine hierarchical features between the encoder and decoder layers. Experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that our SP-Net outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhou_Specificity-Preserving_RGB-D_Saliency_Detection_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
3DVG-Transformer: Relation Modeling for Visual Grounding on Point Clouds,"Lichen Zhao, Daigang Cai, Lu Sheng, Dong Xu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 2928-2937","Visual grounding on 3D point clouds is an emerging vision and language task that benefits various applications in understanding the 3D visual world.

Inspired by the well-known transformer architecture, we propose a relation-aware visual grounding method on 3D point clouds, named as 3DVG-Transformer, to fully utilize the contextual clues for relationenhanced proposal generation and cross-modal proposal disambiguation, which are enabled by a newly designed coordinate-guided contextual aggregation (CCA) module in the object proposal generation stage, and a multiplex attention (MA) module in the cross-modal feature fusion stage. We validate that our 3DVG-Transformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, on two point cloud-based visual grounding datasets, ScanRefer and Nr3D/Sr3D from ReferIt3D, especially for complex scenarios containing multiple objects of the same category.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhao_3DVG-Transformer_Relation_Modeling_for_Visual_Grounding_on_Point_Clouds_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

Patch Craft: Video Denoising by Deep Modeling and Patch Matching,"Gregory Vaksman, Michael Elad, Peyman Milanfar"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 2157-2166","The non-local self-similarity property of natural images has been exploited extensively for solving various image processing problems. When it comes to video sequences, harnessing this force is even more beneficial due to the temporal redundancy. In the context of image and video denoising, many classically-oriented algorithms employ self-similarity, splitting the data into overlapping patches, gathering groups of similar ones and processing these together somehow. With the emergence of convolutional neural networks (CNN), the patch-based framework has been abandoned. Most CNN denoisers operate on the whole image, leveraging non-local relations only implicitly by using a large receptive field. This work proposes a novel approach for leveraging self-similarity in the context of video denoising, while still relying on a regular convolutional architecture. We introduce a concept of patch-craft frames - artificial frames that are similar to the real ones, built by tiling matched patches. Our algorithm augments video sequences with patch-craft frames and feeds them to a CNN. We demonstrate the substantial boost in denoising performance obtained with the proposed approach.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Vaksman_Patch_Craft_Video_Denoising_by_Deep_Modeling_and_Patch_Matching_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Image Manipulation Detection by Multi-View Multi-Scale Supervision,"Xinru Chen, Chengbo Dong, Jiaqi Ji, Juan Cao, Xirong Li"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 14185-14193","The key challenge of image manipulation detection is how to learn generalizable features that are sensitive to manipulations in novel data, whilst specific to prevent false alarms on authentic images. Current research emphasizes the sensitivity, with the specificity overlooked. In this paper we address both aspects by multi-view feature learning and multi-scale supervision. By exploiting noise distribution and boundary artifact surrounding tampered regions, the former aims to learn semantic-agnostic and thus more generalizable features. The latter allows us to learn from authentic images which are nontrivial to taken into account by current semantic segmentation network based methods. Our thoughts are realized by a new network which we term MVSS-Net. Extensive experiments on five benchmark sets justify the viability of MVSS-Net for both pixel-level and image-level manipulation detection.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Chen_Image_Manipulation_Detection_by_Multi-View_Multi-Scale_Supervision_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Perturbed Self-Distillation: Weakly Supervised Large-Scale Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation,"Yachao Zhang, Yanyun Qu, Yuan Xie, Zonghao Li, Shanshan Zheng, Cuihua Li"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 15520-15528","Large-scale point cloud semantic segmentation has wide applications. Current popular researches mainly focus on fully supervised learning which demands expensive and tedious manual point-wise annotation. Weakly supervised learning is an alternative way to avoid this exhausting annotation. However, for large-scale point clouds with few labeled points, the network is difficult to extract discriminative features for unlabeled points, as well as the regularization of topology between labeled and unlabeled points is usually ignored, resulting in incorrect segmentation results. To address this problem, we propose a perturbed self-distillation (PSD) framework. Specifically, inspired by self-supervised learning, we construct the perturbed branch and enforce the predictive consistency among the perturbed branch and original branch. In this way, the graph topology of the whole point cloud can be effectively established by the introduced auxiliary supervision, such that the information propagation between the labeled and unlabeled points will be realized. Besides point-level supervision, we present a well-integrated context-aware module to explicitly regularize the affinity correlation of labeled points. Therefore, the graph topology of the point cloud can be further refined. The experimental results evaluated on three large-scale datasets show the large gain (3.0% on average) against recent weakly supervised methods and comparable results to some fully supervised methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhang_Perturbed_Self-Distillation_Weakly_Supervised_Large-Scale_Point_Cloud_Semantic_Segmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Cherry-Picking Gradients: Learning Low-Rank Embeddings of Visual Data via Differentiable Cross-Approximation,"Mikhail Usvyatsov, Anastasia Makarova, Rafael Ballester-Ripoll, Maxim Rakhuba, Andreas Krause, Konrad Schindler"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 11426-11435","We propose an end-to-end trainable framework that processes large-scale visual data tensors by looking at a fraction of their entries only. Our method combines a neural network encoder with a tensor train decomposition to learn a low-rank latent encoding, coupled with cross-approximation (CA) to learn the representation through a subset of the original samples. CA is an adaptive sampling algorithm that is native to tensor decompositions and avoids working with the full high-resolution data explicitly. Instead, it actively selects local representative samples that we fetch out-of-core and on demand. The required number of samples grows only logarithmically with the size of the input. Our implicit representation of the tensor in the network enables processing large grids that could not be otherwise tractable in their uncompressed form. The proposed approach is particularly useful for large-scale multidimensional grid data (e.g., 3D tomography), and for tasks that require context over a large receptive field (e.g., predicting the medical condition of entire organs).

Ask&Confirm: Active Detail Enriching for Cross-Modal Retrieval With Partial Query,"Guanyu Cai, Jun Zhang, Xinyang Jiang, Yifei Gong, Lianghua He, Fufu Yu, Pai Peng, Xiaowei Guo, Feiyue Huang, Xing Sun"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 1835-1844","Text-based image retrieval has seen considerable progress in recent years. However, the performance of existing methods suffers in real life since the user is likely to provide an incomplete description of an image, which often leads to results filled with false positives that fit the incomplete description. In this work, we introduce the partial-query problem and extensively analyze its influence on text-based image retrieval. Previous interactive methods tackle the problem by passively receiving users' feedback to supplement the incomplete query iteratively, which is time-consuming and requires heavy user effort. Instead, we propose a novel retrieval framework that conducts the interactive process in an Ask-and-Confirm fashion, where AI actively searches for discriminative details missing in the current query, and users only need to confirm AI's proposal. Specifically, we propose an object-based interaction to make the interactive retrieval more user-friendly and present a reinforcement-learning-based policy to search for discriminative objects. Furthermore, since fully-supervised training is often infeasible due to the difficulty of obtaining human-machine dialog data, we present a weakly-supervised training strategy that needs no human-annotated dialogs other than a text-image dataset. Experiments show that our framework significantly improves the performance of text-based image retrieval.

In this work, we address it for the first time using a single event camera, i.e., an asynchronous vision sensor reacting on brightness changes. Our EventHands approach has characteristics previously not demonstrated with a single RGB or depth camera such as high temporal resolution at low data throughputs and real-time performance at 1000 Hz. Due to the different data modality of event cameras compared to classical cameras, existing methods cannot be directly applied to and re-trained for event streams. We thus design a new neural approach which accepts a new event stream representation suitable for learning, which is trained on newly-generated synthetic event streams and can generalise to real data. Experiments show that EventHands outperforms recent monocular methods using a colour (or depth) camera in terms of accuracy and its ability to capture hand motions of unprecedented speed.

Composable Augmentation Encoding for Video Representation Learning,"Chen Sun, Arsha Nagrani, Yonglong Tian, Cordelia Schmid"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 8834-8844","We focus on contrastive methods for self-supervised video representation learning. A common paradigm in contrastive learning is to construct positive pairs by sampling different data views for the same instance, with different data instances as negatives. These methods implicitly assume a set of representational invariances to the view selection mechanism (e.g., sampling frames with temporal shifts), which may lead to poor performance on downstream tasks which violate these invariances (fine-grained video action recognition that would benefit from temporal information). To overcome this limitation, we propose an `augmentation aware' contrastive learning framework, where we explicitly provide a sequence of augmentation parameterisations (such as the values of the time shifts used to create data views) as composable augmentation encodings (CATE) to our model when projecting the video representations for contrastive learning.

Exploiting Explanations for Model Inversion Attacks,"Xuejun Zhao, Wencan Zhang, Xiaokui Xiao, Brian Lim"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 682-692","The successful deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in many domains from healthcare to hiring requires their responsible use, particularly in model explanations and privacy. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) provides more information to help users to understand model decisions, yet this additional knowledge exposes additional risks for privacy attacks. Hence, providing explanation harms privacy. We study this risk for image-based model inversion attacks and identified several attack architectures with increasing performance to reconstruct private image data from model explanations. We have developed several multi-modal transposed CNN architectures that achieve significantly higher inversion performance than using the target model prediction only. These XAI-aware inversion models were designed to exploit the spatial knowledge in image explanations. To understand which explanations have higher privacy risk, we analyzed how various explanation types and factors influence inversion performance. In spite of some models not providing explanations, we further demonstrate increased inversion performance even for non-explainable target models by exploiting explanations of surrogate models through attention transfer. This method first inverts an explanation from the target prediction, then reconstructs the target image.

Score-Based Point Cloud Denoising,"Shitong Luo, Wei Hu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 4583-4592","Point clouds acquired from scanning devices are often perturbed by noise, which affects downstream tasks such as surface reconstruction and analysis. The distribution of a noisy point cloud can be viewed as the distribution of a set of noise-free samples p(x) convolved with some noise model n, leading to (p * n)(x) whose mode is the underlying clean surface. To denoise a noisy point cloud, we propose to increase the log-likelihood of each point from p * n via gradient ascent---iteratively updating each point's position. Since p * n is unknown at test-time, and we only need the score (i.e., the gradient of the log-probability function) to perform gradient ascent, we propose a neural network architecture to estimate the score of p * n given only noisy point clouds as input. We derive objective functions for training the network and develop a denoising algorithm leveraging on the estimated scores. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods under a variety of noise models, and shows the potential to be applied in other tasks such as point cloud upsampling.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Luo_Score-Based_Point_Cloud_Denoising_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

Unlike existing approaches that attempt to learn useful features by maximizing similarity between augmented versions of each input image or by speculatively picking negative samples, we instead also make use of the natural variation that occurs in image collections that are captured using static monitoring cameras. To achieve this, we exploit readily available context data that encodes information such as the spatial and temporal relationships between the input images. We are able to learn representations that are surprisingly effective for downstream supervised classification, by first identifying high probability positive pairs at training time, i.e. those images that are likely to depict the same visual concept. For the critical task of global biodiversity monitoring, this results in image features that can be adapted to challenging visual species classification tasks with limited human supervision.

Unlike the recently-proposed Vision Transformer (ViT) that was designed for image classification specifically, we introduce the Pyramid Vision Transformer (PVT), which overcomes the difficulties of porting Transformer to various dense prediction tasks. PVT has several merits compared to current state of the arts. (1) Different from ViT that typically yields low-resolution outputs and incurs high computational and memory costs, PVT not only can be trained on dense partitions of an image to achieve high output resolution, which is important for dense prediction, but also uses a progressive shrinking pyramid to reduce the computations of large feature maps. (2) PVT inherits the advantages of both CNN and Transformer, making it a unified backbone for various vision tasks without convolutions, where it can be used as a direct replacement for CNN backbones. (3) We validate PVT through extensive experiments, showing that it boosts the performance of many downstream tasks, including object detection, instance and semantic segmentation. For example, with a comparable number of parameters, PVT+RetinaNet achieves 40.4 AP on the COCO dataset, surpassing ResNet50+RetinNet (36.3 AP) by 4.1 absolute AP.

A common image retrieval practice is to firstly retrieve candidate images via similarity search using global image features and then re-rank the candidates by leveraging their local features. Previous learning-based studies mainly focus on either global or local image representation learning to tackle the retrieval task. In this paper, we abandon the two-stage paradigm and seek to design an effective single-stage solution by integrating local and global information inside images into compact image representations. Specifically, we propose a Deep Orthogonal Local and Global (DOLG) information fusion framework for end-to-end image retrieval. It attentively extracts representative local information with multi-atrous convolutions and self-attention at first. Components orthogonal to the global image representation are then extracted from the local information. At last, the orthogonal components are concatenated with the global representation as a complementary, and then aggregation is performed to generate the final representation.

However, as flares may appear in a variety of shapes, positions, and colors, detecting and removing them entirely from an image is very challenging. Existing methods rely on predefined intensity and geometry priors of flares, and may fail to distinguish the difference between light sources and flare artifacts. We observe that the conditions of the light source in the image play an important role in the resulting flares. In this paper, we present a deep framework with light source aware guidance for single-image flare removal (SIFR). In particular, we first detect the light source regions and the flare regions separately, and then remove the flare artifacts based on the light source aware guidance. By learning the underlying relationships between the two types of regions, our approach can remove different kinds of flares from the image. In addition, instead of using paired training data which are difficult to collect, we propose the first unpaired flare removal dataset and new cycle-consistency constraints to obtain more diverse examples and avoid manual annotations.

The use of multiple reference images together with attention-based sampling is demonstrated to achieve significantly improved performance over state-of-the-art reference super-resolution approaches on multiple benchmark datasets. Reference super-resolution approaches have recently been proposed to overcome the ill-posed problem of image super-resolution by providing additional information from a high-resolution reference image. Multi-reference super-resolution extends this approach by providing a more diverse pool of image features to overcome the inherent information deficit whilst maintaining memory efficiency. A novel hierarchical attention-based sampling approach is introduced to learn the similarity between low-resolution image features and multiple reference images based on a perceptual loss. Ablation demonstrates the contribution of both multi-reference and hierarchical attention-based sampling to overall performance.

However, the ranking correlation between the architectures' predicted accuracy and their actual capability is incorrect, which causes the existing NAS methods' dilemma. We attribute this ranking correlation problem to the supernet training consistency shift, including feature shift and parameter shift. Feature shift is identified as dynamic input distributions of a hidden layer due to random path sampling. The input distribution dynamic affects the loss descent and finally affects architecture ranking. Parameter shift is identified as contradictory parameter updates for a shared layer lay in different paths in different training steps.

Most SGGs silently exploit datasets' bias on relationships' context, i.e. its subject and object, to improve recall and neglect spatial and visual evidence, e.g. having seen a glut of data for person wearing shirt, they are overconfident that every person is wearing every shirt. Such imprecise predictions are mainly ascribed to the lack of negative examples for most relationships, fact that obstructs models from meaningfully learning predicates, even those which have ample positive examples. We first present an in-depth investigation of the context bias issue to showcase that all examined state-of-the-art SGGs share the above vulnerabilities. In response, we propose a semi-supervised scheme that forces predicted triplets to be grounded consistently back to the image, in a closed-loop manner.

To avoid information loss from non-key frames, a partial feature update (PFU) network is designed to partially update the propagated features with the local features extracted on a non-key frame if a large disparity between the two is quickly assessed. As a result, consistent and information-rich features can be obtained for each frame.

By adopting a Bayesian treatment, our Bayesian Deep Basis Fitting (BDBF) approach is able to 1) predict high-quality uncertainty estimates and 2) enable depth completion with few or no sparse measurements. We conduct controlled experiments to compare BDBF against commonly used techniques for uncertainty estimation under various scenarios. Results show that our method produces better uncertainty estimates with accurate depth prediction.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Qu_Bayesian_Deep_Basis_Fitting_for_Depth_Completion_With_Uncertainty_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

This field sees recent improvement owing to the meta-learning techniques by learning how to match between the query image and few-shot class examples, such that the learned model can generalize to few-shot novel classes. However, currently, most of the meta-learning-based methods perform parwise matching between query image regions (usually proposals) and novel classes separately, therefore failing to take into account multiple relationships among them. In this paper, we propose a novel FSOD model using heterogeneous graph convolutional networks.

Inspired by the neurobiology research about the independence of remembering and forgetting, we propose to re-parameterize a CNN into the remembering parts and forgetting parts, where the former learn to maintain the performance and the latter learn to prune. Via training with regular SGD on the former but a novel update rule with penalty gradients on the latter, we realize structured sparsity. Then we equivalently merge the remembering and forgetting parts into the original architecture with narrower layers. In this sense, ResRep can be viewed as a successful application of Structural Re-parameterization. Such a methodology distinguishes ResRep from the traditional learning-based pruning paradigm that applies a penalty on parameters to produce sparsity, which may suppress the parameters essential for the remembering. ResRep slims down a standard ResNet-50 with 76.15% accuracy on ImageNet to a narrower one with only 45% FLOPs and no accuracy drop, which is the first to achieve lossless pruning with such a high compression ratio.

This is not only very expensive but also sensitive to ambiguity and subjective annotation bias, a much harder task than image labelling. In this work, we develop a more accurate weakly-supervised solution by introducing Cross-Sentence Relations Mining (CRM) in video moment proposal generation and matching when only a paragraph description of activities without per-sentence temporal annotation is available.

Its performance however degrades notably in indoor environments because of the lack of textures. Without rich textures, the photometric consistency is too weak to train a good depth network. Inspired by the early works on indoor modeling, we leverage the structural regularities exhibited in indoor scenes, to train a better depth network. Specifically, we adopt two extra supervisory signals for self-supervised training: 1) the Manhattan normal constraint and 2) the co-planar constraint. The Manhattan normal constraint enforces the major surfaces (the floor, ceiling, and walls) to be aligned with dominant directions. The co-planar constraint states that the 3D points be well fitted by a plane if they are located within the same planar region. To generate the supervisory signals, we adopt two components to classify the major surface normal into dominant directions and detect the planar regions on the fly during training. As the predicted depth becomes more accurate after more training epochs, the supervisory signals also improve and in turn feedback to obtain a better depth model. Through extensive experiments on indoor benchmark datasets, the results show that our network outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Chirikjian"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 15293-15302","Probabilistic point cloud registration methods are becoming more popular because of their robustness. However, unlike point-to-plane variants of iterative closest point (ICP) which incorporate local surface geometric information such as surface normals, most probabilistic methods (e.g., coherent point drift (CPD)) ignore such information and build Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) with isotropic Gaussian covariances. This results in sphere-like GMM components which only penalize the point-to-point distance between the two point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel method called CPD with Local Surface Geometry (LSG-CPD) for rigid point cloud registration. Our method adaptively adds different levels of point-to-plane penalization on top of the point-to-point penalization based on the flatness of the local surface. This results in GMM components with anisotropic covariances. We formulate point cloud registration as a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) problem and solve it with the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. In the E step, we demonstrate that the computation can be recast into simple matrix manipulations and efficiently computed on a GPU. In the M step, we perform an unconstrained optimization on a matrix Lie group to efficiently update the rigid transformation of the registration.

In our sampling network module, given a pair of point clouds, the sampling network learns a prior sampling distribution over the transformation space. The learned sampling distribution can be used as a ""good"""" initialization of the differentiable CEM module. In our differentiable CEM module, we first propose a maximum consensus criterion based alignment metric as the reward function for the point cloud registration task. Based on the reward function, for each state, we then construct a fused score function to evaluate the sampled transformations, where we weight the current and future rewards of the transformations. Particularly, the future rewards of the sampled transforms are obtained by performing the iterative closest point (ICP) algorithm on the transformed state. By selecting the top-k transformations with the highest scores, we iteratively update the sampling distribution. Furthermore, in order to make the CEM differentiable, we use the sparsemax function to replace the hard top-k selection.

To address this task, systems usually rely on a retrieval step that uses global image descriptors, and a subsequent step that performs domain-specific refinements or reranking by leveraging operations such as geometric verification based on local features. In this work, we propose Reranking Transformers (RRTs) as a general model to incorporate both local and global features to rerank the matching images in a supervised fashion and thus replace the relatively expensive process of geometric verification. RRTs are lightweight and can be easily parallelized so that reranking a set of top matching results can be performed in a single forward-pass. We perform extensive experiments on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets, and the Google Landmarks v2 dataset, showing that RRTs outperform previous reranking approaches while using much fewer local descriptors.

Supervised methods highly rely on massive annotated samples. The existing two unsupervised methods are prone to failure on degenerated samples. This paper proposes a Mutual-Complementing Framework (MCF) for nuclei detection and segmentation in pathology images. Two branches of MCF are trained in the mutual-complementing manner, where the detection branch complements the pseudo mask of the segmentation branch, while the progressive trained segmentation branch complements the missing nucleus templates through calculating the mask residual between the predicted mask and detected result. In the detection branch, two response map fusion strategies and gradient direction based postprocessing are devised to obtain the optimal detection response. Furthermore, the confidence loss combined with the synthetic samples and self-finetuning is adopted to train the segmentation network with only high confidence areas.

Existing transferable attacks tend to craft adversarial examples by indiscriminately distorting features to degrade prediction accuracy in a source model without aware of intrinsic features of objects in the images. We argue that such brute-force degradation would introduce model-specific local optimum into adversarial examples, thus limiting the transferability. By contrast, we propose the Feature Importance-aware Attack (FIA), which disrupts important object-aware features that dominate model decisions consistently. More specifically, we obtain feature importance by introducing the aggregate gradient, which averages the gradients with respect to feature maps of the source model, computed on a batch of random transforms of the original clean image. The gradients will be highly correlated to objects of interest, and such correlation presents invariance across different models. Besides, the random transforms will preserve intrinsic features of objects and suppress model-specific information. Finally, the feature importance guides to search for adversarial examples towards disrupting critical features, achieving stronger transferability. Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and superior performance of the proposed FIA, i.e., improving the success rate by 9.5% against normally trained models and 12.8% against defense models as compared to the state-of-the-art transferable attacks.

Although current literature on the transfer-based adversarial attack has achieved promising results for improving the transferability to unseen black-box models, it still leaves a long way to go. Inspired by the idea of meta-learning, this paper proposes a novel architecture called Meta Gradient Adversarial Attack (MGAA), which is plug-and-play and can be integrated with any existing gradient-based attack method for improving the cross-model transferability. Specifically, we randomly sample multiple models from a model zoo to compose different tasks and iteratively simulate a white-box attack and a black-box attack in each task. By narrowing the gap between the gradient directions in white-box and black-box attacks, the transferability of adversarial examples on the black-box setting can be improved. Extensive experiments on the CIFAR10 and ImageNet datasets show that our architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for both black-box and white-box attack settings.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Yuan_Meta_Gradient_Adversarial_Attack_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

In this paper, we propose PointSeaConv, i.e., a novel differential convolution search paradigm on point clouds. It can work in a purely data-driven manner and thus is capable of auto-creating a group of suitable convolutions for geometric shape modeling. We also propose a joint optimization framework for simultaneous search of internal convolution and external architecture, and introduce epsilon-greedy algorithm to alleviate the effect of discretization error. As a result, PointSeaNet, a deep network that is sufficient to capture geometric shapes at both convolution level and architecture level, can be searched out for point cloud processing.

Conversely, the movement of an object provides crucial information about its underlying distinctive kinematics and the interdependencies between its parts. This two-way relation motivates learning a bijective mapping between object kinematics and plausible future image sequences.

This tends to limit their effectiveness on small models, which are more preferable in scenarios where storage or computing resources are very limited (e.g., mobile devices). In this paper, we leverage the concept of knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of small models by distilling from adversarially trained large models.

Some of the most efficient algorithms for finding global minimum cuts are randomized algorithms based on Karger's groundbreaking contraction algorithm. Here, we study whether Karger's algorithm can be successfully generalized to other cut problems. We first prove that a wide class of natural generalizations of Karger's algorithm cannot efficiently solve the s-t-mincut or the normalized cut problem to optimality. However, we then present a simple new algorithm for seeded segmentation / graph-based semi-supervised learning that is closely based on Karger's original algorithm, showing that for these problems, extensions of Karger's algorithm can be useful. The new algorithm has linear asymptotic runtime and yields a potential that can be interpreted as the posterior probability of a sample belonging to a given seed / class. We clarify its relation to the random walker algorithm / harmonic energy minimization in terms of distributions over spanning forests.

Being bound to local convolutions, CNNs need explicit 3D biases to model geometric transformations. In contrast, we demonstrate that a transformer-based model can synthesize entirely novel views without any hand-engineered 3D biases. This is achieved by (i) a global attention mechanism for implicitly learning long-range 3D correspondences between source and target views, and (ii) a probabilistic formulation necessary to capture the ambiguity inherent in predicting novel views from a single image, thereby overcoming the limitations of previous approaches that are restricted to relatively small viewpoint changes. We evaluate various ways to integrate 3D priors into a transformer architecture.

Scaling-Up Disentanglement for Image Translation,"Aviv Gabbay, Yedid Hoshen"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 6783-6792","Image translation methods typically aim to manipulate a set of labeled attributes (given as supervision at training time e.g. domain label) while leaving the unlabeled attributes intact. Current methods achieve either: (i) disentanglement, which exhibits low visual fidelity and can only be satisfied where the attributes are perfectly uncorrelated. (ii) visually-plausible translations, which are clearly not disentangled. In this work, we propose OverLORD, a single framework for disentangling labeled and unlabeled attributes as well as synthesizing high-fidelity images, which is composed of two stages; (i) Disentanglement: Learning disentangled representations with latent optimization. Differently from previous approaches, we do not rely on adversarial training or any architectural biases. (ii) Synthesis: Training feed-forward encoders for inferring the learned attributes and tuning the generator in an adversarial manner to increase the perceptual quality. When the labeled and unlabeled attributes are correlated, we model an additional representation that accounts for the correlated attributes and improves disentanglement.

We pay attention to a typical relationship, relative saliency. A closely related task, salient object detection, predicts a binary map highlighting a visually salient region while hard to distinguish multiple objects. Directly combining two tasks by post-processing also leads to poor performance. There is a lack of research on relative saliency at present, limiting the practical applications such as content-aware image cropping, video summary, and image labeling. In this paper, we study the Salient Object Ranking (SOR) task, which manages to assign a ranking order of each detected object according to its visual saliency. We propose the first end-to-end framework of the SOR task and solve it in a multi-task learning fashion. The framework handles instance segmentation and salient object ranking simultaneously. In this framework, the SOR branch is independent and flexible to cooperate with different detection methods, so that easy to use as a plugin. We also introduce a Position-Preserved Attention (PPA) module tailored for the SOR branch. It consists of the position embedding stage and feature interaction stage. Considering the importance of position in saliency comparison, we preserve absolute coordinates of objects in ROI pooling operation and then fuse positional information with semantic features in the first stage. In the feature interaction stage, we apply the attention mechanism to obtain proposals' contextualized representations to predict their relative ranking orders.

There are two types of approaches for LT-reID: biometrics-based approach and data adaptation based approach. The former one is to seek clothing irrelevant biometric features. However, seeking high quality biometric feature is the main concern. The latter one adopts fine-tuning strategy by using data with significant clothing change. However, the performance is compromised when it is applied to cases without clothing change. This work argues that these approaches in fact are not aware of clothing status (i.e., change or no-change) of a pedestrian. Instead, they blindly assume all footages of a pedestrian have different clothes. To tackle this issue, a Regularization via Clothing Status Awareness Network (RCSANet) is proposed to regularize descriptions of a pedestrian by embedding the clothing status awareness.

Low Curvature Activations Reduce Overfitting in Adversarial Training,"Vasu Singla, Sahil Singla, Soheil Feizi, David Jacobs"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 16423-16433","Adversarial training is one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks. Previous works suggest that overfitting is a dominant phenomenon in adversarial training leading to a large generalization gap between test and train accuracy in neural networks. In this work, we show that the observed generalization gap is closely related to the choice of the activation function. In particular, we show that using activation functions with low (exact or approximate) curvature values has a regularization effect that significantly reduces both the standard and robust generalization gaps in adversarial training. We observe this effect for both differentiable/smooth activations such as SiLU as well as non-differentiable/non-smooth activations such as LeakyReLU. In the latter case, the ""approximate"" curvature of the activation is low.

However, more extensive applications of such IoT systems are still limited by two challenges. First, some applications, especially medicine- and wearable-related ones, impose stringent requirements on the camera form factor. Second, powerful CNNs often require considerable storage and energy cost, whereas IoT devices often suffer from limited resources. PhlatCam, with its form factor potentially reduced by orders of magnitude, has emerged as a promising solution to the first aforementioned challenge, while the second one remains a bottleneck. Existing compression techniques, which can potentially tackle the second challenge, are far from realizing the full potential in storage and energy reduction, because they mostly focus on the CNN algorithm itself. To this end, this work proposes SACoD, a Sensor Algorithm Co-Design framework to develop more efficient CNN-powered PhlatCam. In particular, the mask coded in the PhlatCam sensor and the backend CNN model are jointly optimized in terms of both model parameters and architectures via differential neural architecture search. Extensive experiments including both simulation and physical measurement on manufactured masks show that the proposed SACoD framework achieves aggressive model compression and energy savings while maintaining or even boosting the task accuracy, when benchmarking over two state-of-the-art (SOTA) designs with six datasets across four different vision tasks including classification, segmentation, image translation, and face recognition.

It is observed that the most informative region in each frame of a video is usually a small image patch, which shifts smoothly across frames. Therefore, we model the patch localization problem as a sequential decision task, and propose a reinforcement learning based approach for efficient spatially adaptive video recognition (AdaFocus). In specific, a light-weighted ConvNet is first adopted to quickly process the full video sequence, whose features are used by a recurrent policy network to localize the most task-relevant regions. Then the selected patches are inferred by a high-capacity network for the final prediction. During offline inference, once the informative patch sequence has been generated, the bulk of computation can be done in parallel, and is efficient on modern GPU devices. In addition, we demonstrate that the proposed method can be easily extended by further considering the temporal redundancy, e.g., dynamically skipping less valuable frames. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets, i.e., ActivityNet, FCVID, Mini-Kinetics, Something-Something V1&V2, demonstrate that our method is significantly more efficient than the competitive baselines.

Conventional CNNs/RNNs assume one-to-one mapping, and thus tend to predict the average of all possible target motions, resulting in plain/boring motions during inference. In order to overcome this problem, we propose a novel conditional variational autoencoder (VAE) that explicitly models one-to-many audio-to-motion mapping by splitting the cross-modal latent code into shared code and motion-specific code. The shared code mainly models the strong correlation between audio and motion (such as the synchronized audio and motion beats), while the motion-specific code captures diverse motion information independent of the audio. However, splitting the latent code into two parts poses training difficulties for the VAE model. A mapping network facilitating random sampling along with other techniques including relaxed motion loss, bicycle constraint, and diversity loss are designed to better train the VAE. Experiments on both 3D and 2D motion datasets verify that our method generates more realistic and diverse motions than state-of-the-art methods, quantitatively and qualitatively.

However, previous methods usually suffered from discrete nature of point cloud and unstructured prediction of points in local regions, which makes it hard to reveal fine local geometric details on the complete shape. To resolve this issue, we propose SnowflakeNet with Snowflake Point Deconvolution (SPD) to generate the complete point clouds. The SnowflakeNet models the generation of complete point clouds as the snowflake-like growth of points in 3D space, where the child points are progressively generated by splitting their parent points after each SPD. Our insight of revealing detailed geometry is to introduce skip-transformer in SPD to learn point splitting patterns which can fit local regions the best. Skip-transformer leverages attention mechanism to summarize the splitting patterns used in the previous SPD layer to produce the splitting in the current SPD layer. The locally compact and structured point cloud generated by SPD is able to precisely capture the structure characteristic of 3D shape in local patches, which enables the network to predict highly detailed geometries, such as smooth regions, sharp edges and corners.

This paper proposes a new paradigm for unsupervised domain adaptation, termed as Active Universal Domain Adaptation (AUDA), which removes all label set assumptions and aims for not only recognizing target samples from source classes but also inferring those from target-private classes by using active learning to annotate a small budget of target data. For AUDA, it is challenging to jointly adapt the model to the target domain and select informative target samples for annotations under a large domain gap and significant semantic shift. To address the problems, we propose an Active Universal Adaptation Network (AUAN). Specifically, we first introduce Adversarial and Diverse Curriculum Learning (ADCL), which progressively aligns source and target domains to classify whether target samples are from source classes. Then, we propose a Clustering Non-transferable Gradient Embedding (CNTGE) strategy, which utilizes the clues of transferability, diversity, and uncertainty to annotate target informative sample, making it possible to infer labels for target samples of target-private classes. Finally, we propose to jointly train ADCL and CNTGE with target supervision to promote domain adaptation and target-private class recognition.

In this paper, we prove that their biased evaluation is due to inherent unfairness in the supernet training. In view of this, we propose two levels of constraints: expectation fairness and strict fairness. Particularly, strict fairness ensures equal optimization opportunities for all choice blocks throughout the training, which neither overestimates nor underestimates their capacity. We demonstrate that this is crucial for improving the confidence of models' ranking.

Prior approaches are typically degradation-specific and employ the same processing across different images and different pixels within. However, we hypothesize that such spatially rigid processing is suboptimal for simultaneously restoring the degraded pixels as well as reconstructing the clean regions of the image. To overcome this limitation, we propose SPAIR, a network design that harnesses distortion-localization information and dynamically adjusts computation to difficult regions in the image. SPAIR comprises of two components, (1) a localization network that identifies degraded pixels, and (2) a restoration network that exploits knowledge from the localization network in filter and feature domain to selectively and adaptively restore degraded pixels. Our key idea is to exploit the non-uniformity of heavy degradations in spatial-domain and suitably embed this knowledge within distortion-guided modules performing sparse normalization, feature extraction and attention. Our architecture is agnostic to physical formation model and generalizes across several types of spatially-varying degradations.

We refer to this novel problem as visual relationship co-localization or VRC as an abbreviation. VRC is a challenging task, even more so than the well-studied object co-localization task. This becomes further challenging when using just a few images, the model has to learn to co-localize visual subject-object pairs connected via unseen predicates. To solve VRC, we propose an optimization framework to select a common visual relationship in each image of the bag. The goal of the optimization framework is to find the optimal solution by learning visual relationship similarity across images in a few-shot setting. To obtain robust visual relationship representation, we utilize a simple yet effective technique that learns relationship embedding as a translation vector from visual subject to visual object in a shared space. Further, to learn visual relationship similarity, we utilize a proven meta-learning technique commonly used for few-shot classification tasks. Finally, to tackle the combinatorial complexity challenge arising from an exponential number of feasible solutions, we use a greedy approximation inference algorithm that selects approximately the best solution.

Particularly, several class activation mapping (CAM) based methods, which generate visual explanation maps by a linear combination of activation maps from CNNs, have been proposed. However, the majority of the methods lack a clear theoretical basis on how they assign the coefficients of the linear combination. In this paper, we revisit the intrinsic linearity of CAM with respect to the activation maps; we construct an explanation model of CNN as a linear function of binary variables that denote the existence of the corresponding activation maps. With this approach, the explanation model can be determined by additive feature attribution methods in an analytic manner. We then demonstrate the adequacy of SHAP values, which is a unique solution for the explanation model with a set of desirable properties, as the coefficients of CAM. Since the exact SHAP values are unattainable, we introduce an efficient approximation method, LIFT-CAM, based on DeepLIFT.

In this paper, we propose a simple yet efficient preference reasoning framework (PR-Net) to explicitly take the diverse interests into account for frame-level highlight prediction.

Our approach is based on the normalizing flows model and offers a series of advantages. For conventional applications, where a single 3D estimate is required, our formulation allows for efficient mode computation. Using the mode leads to performance that is comparable with the state of the art among deterministic unimodal regression models.

Such losses, however, are limited because 2D keypoints do not supervise body shape and segmentations of people in clothing do not match projected minimally-clothed SMPL shapes. To exploit richer image information about clothed people, we introduce higher-level semantic information about clothing to penalize clothed and non-clothed regions of the image differently. To do so, we train a body regressor using a novel ""Differentiable Semantic Rendering - DSR"" loss. For Minimally-Clothed regions, we define the DSR-MC loss, which encourages a tight match between a rendered SMPL body and the minimally-clothed regions of the image. For clothed regions, we define the DSR-C loss to encourage the rendered SMPL body to be inside the clothing mask. To ensure end-to-end differentiable training, we learn a semantic clothing prior for SMPL vertices from thousands of clothed human scans. We perform extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments to evaluate the role of clothing semantics on the accuracy of 3D human pose and shape estimation.

A mainstream of DA methods is to align the feature distributions of the two domains. However, the majority of them focus on the entire image features where irrelevant semantic information, e.g., the messy background, is inevitably embedded. Enforcing feature alignments in such case will negatively influence the correct matching of objects and consequently lead to the semantically negative transfer due to the confusion of irrelevant semantics. To tackle this issue, we propose Semantic Concentration for Domain Adaptation (SCDA), which encourages the model to concentrate on the most principal features via the pair-wise adversarial alignment of prediction distributions. Specifically, we train the classifier to class-wisely maximize the prediction distribution divergence of each sample pair, which enables the model to find the region with large differences among the same class of samples. Meanwhile, the feature extractor attempts to minimize that discrepancy, which suppresses the features of dissimilar regions among the same class of samples and accentuates the features of principal parts.

Given a colored point cloud and a 360 panorama image of a scene, our objective is to recover the camera pose at which the panorama image is taken. Our pipeline works in an off-the-shelf manner with a single image given as a query and does not require any training of neural networks or collecting ground-truth poses of images. Instead, we match each point cloud color to the holistic view of the panorama image with gradient-descent optimization to find the camera pose. Our loss function, called sampling loss, is point cloud-centric, evaluated at the projected location of every point in the point cloud. In contrast, conventional photometric loss is image-centric, comparing colors at each pixel location. With a simple change in the compared entities, sampling loss effectively overcomes the severe visual distortion of omnidirectional images, and enjoys the global context of the 360 view to handle challenging scenarios for visual localization. PICCOLO outperforms existing omnidirectional localization algorithms in both accuracy and stability when evaluated in various environments.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Kim_PICCOLO_Point_Cloud-Centric_Omnidirectional_Localization_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Distributional Robustness Loss for Long-Tail Learning,"Dvir Samuel, Gal Chechik"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 9495-9504","Real-world data is often unbalanced and long-tailed, but deep models struggle to recognize rare classes in the presence of frequent classes. To address unbalanced data, most studies try balancing the data, the loss, or the classifier to reduce classification bias towards head classes. Far less attention has been given to the latent representations learned with unbalanced data. We show that the feature extractor part of deep networks suffers greatly from this bias. We propose a new loss based on robustness theory, which encourages the model to learn high-quality representations for both head and tail classes. While the general form of the robustness loss may be hard to compute, we further derive an easy-to-compute upper bound that can be minimized efficiently. This procedure reduces representation bias towards head classes in the feature space and achieves new SOTA results on CIFAR100-LT, ImageNet-LT, and iNaturalist long-tail benchmarks. We find that training with robustness increases recognition accuracy of tail classes while largely maintaining the accuracy of head classes. The new robustness loss can be combined with various classifier balancing techniques and can be applied to representations at several layers of the deep model.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Samuel_Distributional_Robustness_Loss_for_Long-Tail_Learning_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

There have been plenty of works concentrated on learning with in-distribution (IND) noisy labels in the last decade, i.e., some training samples are assigned incorrect labels that do not correspond to their true classes. Nonetheless, in real application scenarios, it is necessary to consider the influence of out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, i.e., samples that do not belong to any known classes, which has not been sufficiently explored yet. To remedy this, we study a new problem setup, namely Learning with Open-world Noisy Data (LOND). The goal of LOND is to simultaneously learn a classifier and an OOD detector from datasets with mixed IND and OOD noise. In this paper, we propose a new graph-based framework, namely Noisy Graph Cleaning (NGC), which collects clean samples by leveraging geometric structure of data and model predictive confidence. Without any additional training effort, NGC can detect and reject the OOD samples based on the learned class prototypes directly in testing phase.

However, it usually suffers from the out of frame issue due to the limited field-of-view (FoV) of 2D images. In this paper, we introduce a novel task, gaze following in 360-degree images which provide an omnidirectional FoV and can alleviate the out of frame issue. We collect the first dataset, ""GazeFollow360"", for this task, containing around 10,000 360-degree images with complex gaze behaviors under various scenes. Existing 2D gaze following methods suffer from performance degradation in 360-degree images since they may use the assumption that a gaze target is in the 2D gaze sight line. However, this assumption is no longer true for long-distance gaze behaviors in 360-degree images, due to the distortion brought by sphere-to-plane projection. To address this challenge, we propose a 3D sight line guided dual-pathway framework, to detect the gaze target within a local region (here) and from a distant region (there), parallelly. Specifically, the local region is obtained as a 2D cone-shaped field along the 2D projection of the sight line starting at the human subject's head position, and the distant region is obtained by searching along the sight line in 3D sphere space. Finally, the location of the gaze target is determined by fusing the estimations from both the local region and the distant region.

Currently, a typical network combination for CSLR includes a visual module, which focuses on spatial and short-temporal information, followed by a contextual module, which focuses on long-temporal information, and the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) loss is adopted to train the network. However, due to the limitation of chain rules in back-propagation, the visual module is hard to adjust for seeking optimized visual features. As a result, it enforces that the contextual module focuses on contextual information optimization only rather than balancing efficient visual and contextual information. In this paper, we propose a Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation (SMKD) method, which enforces the visual and contextual modules to focus on short-term and long-term information and enhances the discriminative power of both modules simultaneously. Specifically, the visual and contextual modules share the weights of their corresponding classifiers, and train with CTC loss simultaneously. Moreover, the spike phenomenon widely exists with CTC loss. Although it can help us choose a few of the key frames of a gloss, it does drop other frames in a gloss and makes the visual feature saturation in the early stage.

The raw output of these systems are noisy and incomplete 3D points or short tracklets of points. To be useful, one must associate these points with corresponding markers on the captured subject; i.e. ""labelling"". Given these labels, one can then ""solve"" for the 3D skeleton or body surface mesh. Commercial auto-labeling tools require a specific calibration procedure at capture time, which is not possible for archival data. Here we train a novel neural network called SOMA, which takes raw mocap point clouds with varying numbers of points, labels them at scale without any calibration data, independent of the capture technology, and requiring only minimal human intervention. Our key insight is that, while labeling point clouds is highly ambiguous, the 3D body provides strong constraints on the solution that can be exploited by a learning-based method. To enable learning, we generate massive training sets of simulated noisy and ground truth mocap markers animated by 3D bodies from AMASS. SOMA exploits an architecture with stacked self-attention elements to learn the spatial structure of the 3D body and an optimal transport layer to constrain the assignment (labeling) problem while rejecting outliers. We extensively evaluate SOMA both quantitatively and qualitatively. SOMA is more accurate and robust than existing state of the art research methods and can be applied where commercial systems cannot.

This framework integrates ray casting of Snell's law at the refractive interface, multi-view triangulation and specially designed loss functions. Our method is calibration-free, and thus it is easy to collect data outdoors in uncontrolled environments.

We present the first 3D generative model for a drastically different shape representation --- describing a shape as a sequence of computer-aided design (CAD) operations. Unlike meshes and point clouds, CAD models encode the user creation process of 3D shapes, widely used in numerous industrial and engineering design tasks. However, the sequential and irregular structure of CAD operations poses significant challenges for existing 3D generative models. Drawing an analogy between CAD operations and natural language, we propose a CAD generative network based on the Transformer.

We investigate robustness to input perturbations as well as robustness to model perturbations. We find that when pre-trained with a sufficient amount of data, ViT models are at least as robust as the ResNet counterparts on a broad range of perturbations.

We first transform the original features of arbitrary views to a fixed number of view features, dubbed canonical view representation, by aligning the arbitrary view features to a set of learnable reference view features using optimal transport. In this way, each 3D shape with arbitrary views is represented by a fixed number of canonical view features, which are further aggregated to generate a rich and robust 3D shape representation for shape recognition. We also propose a canonical view feature separation constraint to enforce that the view features in canonical view representation can be embedded into scattered points in a Euclidean space.

As large models are often not practical in real-world applications, we investigate and propose novel loss functions, to enable SR with high perceptual quality from much more efficient models. The representative power for a given low-complexity generator network can only be fully leveraged by strong guidance towards the optimal set of parameters. We show that it is possible to improve the performance of a recently introduced efficient generator architecture solely with the application of our proposed loss functions. In particular, we use a Fourier space supervision loss for improved restoration of missing high-frequency (HF) content from the ground truth image and design a discriminator architecture working directly in the Fourier domain to better match the target HF distribution. We show that our losses' direct emphasis on the frequencies in Fourier-space significantly boosts the perceptual image quality, while at the same time retaining high restoration quality in comparison to previously proposed loss functions for this task. The performance is further improved by utilizing a combination of spatial and frequency domain losses, as both representations provide complementary information during training.

A Backdoor Attack Against 3D Point Cloud Classifiers,"Zhen Xiang, David J.

Existing adversarial attacks against 3D PC classifiers are all test-time evasion (TTE) attacks that aim to induce test-time misclassifications using knowledge of the classifier. But since the victim classifier is usually not accessible to the attacker, the threat is largely diminished in practice, as PC TTEs typically have poor transferability. Here, we propose the first backdoor attack (BA) against PC classifiers. Originally proposed for images, BAs poison the victim classifier's training set so that the classifier learns to decide to the attacker's target class whenever the attacker's backdoor pattern is present in a given input sample. Significantly, BAs do not require knowledge of the victim classifier. Different from image BAs, we propose to insert a cluster of points into a PC as a robust backdoor pattern customized for 3D PCs. Such clusters are also consistent with a physical attack (i.e., with a captured object in a scene). We optimize the cluster's location using an independently trained surrogate classifier and choose the cluster's local geometry to evade possible PC preprocessing and PC anomaly detectors (ADs). Experimentally, our BA achieves a uniformly high success rate (>=87%) and shows evasiveness against state-of-the-art PC ADs.

In contrast to prior neural-tree approaches that either adopt a pre-defined structure or grow hierarchical layers in a progressive manner, task-adaptive neural trees in SeBoW evolve from a deep neural network through a construction-by-destruction process, enabling a global-level parameter optimization that further yields favorable results. Specifically, given a designated network configuration like VGG, SeBoW disconnects all the layers and derives isolated filter groups, based on which a global-level wiring process is conducted to attach a subset of filter groups, eventually bearing a lightweight neural tree. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with a lower computational cost, SeBoW outperforms all prior neural trees by a significant margin and even achieves results on par with predominant non-tree networks like ResNets.

Weakly Supervised phrase-Grounding (WSG) deals with the task of using this data to learn to localize (or to ground) arbitrary text phrases in images without any additional annotations. However, most recent SotA methods for WSG assume an existence of a pre-trained object detector, relying on it to produce the ROIs for localization. In this work, we focus on the task of Detector-Free WSG (DF-WSG) to solve WSG without relying on a pre-trained detector. We directly learn everything from the images and associated free-form text pairs, thus potentially gaining advantage on the categories unsupported by the detector. The key idea behind our proposed Grounding by Separation (GbS) method is synthesizing `text to image-regions' associations by random alpha-blending of arbitrary image pairs and using the corresponding texts of the pair as conditions to recover the alpha map from the blended image via a segmentation network. At test time, this allows using the query phrase as a condition for a non-blended query image, thus interpreting the test image as a composition of a region corresponding to the phrase and the complement region. Using this approach we demonstrate a significant accuracy improvement, up to 8.5% over previous DF-WSG SotA, for a range of benchmarks including Flickr30K, Visual Genome, and ReferIt, as well as a significant complementary improvement (above 7%) over the detector-based approaches for WSG.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Arbelle_Detector-Free_Weakly_Supervised_Grounding_by_Separation_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

The final pose estimates are attained from a novel optimization scheme which links high-confidence multi-view 2D observations and 3D joint candidates.

In a defocused image, the blur shapes are similar among pixels although the blur sizes can spatially vary. To utilize the property with inverse kernels, we exploit the observation that when only the size of a defocus blur changes while keeping the shape, the shape of the corresponding inverse kernel remains the same and only the scale changes. Based on the observation, we propose a kernel-sharing parallel atrous convolutional (KPAC) block specifically designed by incorporating the property of inverse kernels for single image defocus deblurring. To effectively simulate the invariant shapes of inverse kernels with different scales, KPAC shares the same convolutional weights among multiple atrous convolution layers. To efficiently simulate the varying scales of inverse kernels, KPAC consists of only a few atrous convolution layers with different dilations and learns per-pixel scale attentions to aggregate the outputs of the layers.

Different from existing methods that represent an indoor scene with the type, location, and other properties of objects in the room and learn the scene layout from a collection of complete 3D indoor scenes, our method models each indoor scene as a 3D semantic scene volume and learns a volumetric generative adversarial network (GAN) from a collection of 2.5D partial observations of 3D scenes. To this end, we apply a differentiable projection layer to project the generated 3D semantic scene volumes into semantic-segmented depth images and design a new multiple-view discriminator for learning the complete 3D scene volume from 2.5D semantic-segmented depth images. Compared to existing methods, our method not only efficiently reduces the workload of modeling and acquiring 3D scenes for training, but also produces better object shapes and their detailed layouts in the scene.

Towards this goal, we present a scale-aware geometric (SAG) loss, which enforces scale consistency through point cloud alignment. Compared to prior arts, SAG loss takes relative scale into consideration during relative motion estimation, enabling more precise alignment and explicit supervision for scale inference. In addition, a novel two-stream architecture for depth estimation is designed, which disentangles scale from depth estimation and allows depth to be learned in a scale-invariant manner.

Here we introduce multi-task self-training (MuST), which harnesses the knowledge in independent specialized teacher models (e.g., ImageNet model on classification) to train a single general student model. Our approach has three steps. First, we train specialized teachers independently on labeled datasets. We then use the specialized teachers to label an unlabeled dataset to create a multi-task pseudo labeled dataset. Finally, the dataset, which now contains pseudo labels from teacher models trained on different datasets/tasks, is then used to train a student model with multi-task learning. We evaluate the feature representations of the student model on 6 vision tasks including image recognition (classification, detection, segmentation) and 3D geometry estimation (depth and surface normal estimation). MuST is scalable with unlabeled or partially labeled datasets and outperforms both specialized supervised models and self-supervised models when training on large scale datasets.

Adaptive Unfolding Total Variation Network for Low-Light Image Enhancement,"Chuanjun Zheng, Daming Shi, Wentian Shi"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 4439-4448","Real-world low-light images suffer from two main degradations, namely, inevitable noise and poor visibility. Since the noise exhibits different levels, its estimation has been implemented in recent works when enhancing low-light images from raw Bayer space. When it comes to sRGB color space, the noise estimation becomes more complicated due to the effect of the image processing pipeline. Nevertheless, most existing enhancing algorithms in sRGB space only focus on the low visibility problem or suppress the noise under a hypothetical noise level, leading them impractical due to the lack of robustness. To address this issue, we propose an adaptive unfolding total variation network (UTVNet), which approximates the noise level from the real sRGB low-light image by learning the balancing parameter in the model-based denoising method with total variation regularization. Meanwhile, we learn the noise level map by unrolling the corresponding minimization process for providing the inferences of smoothness and fidelity constraints. Guided by the noise level map, our UTVNet can recover finer details and is more capable to suppress noise in real captured low-light scenes.

Existing methods represent visual elements by extracting region-based convolutional features inside and outside the cropping view boundaries, without probing a fundamental question: why some visual elements are of interest or of discard?

By instantiating a transformer-based solution that represents visual elements as visual words and that models the dependencies between visual words, we report not only state of-the-art performance on public benchmarks, but also interesting visualizations that depict the attraction and repulsion between visual elements, which may shed light on what makes for effective cropping view recommendation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Pan_TransView_Inside_Outside_and_Across_the_Cropping_View_Boundaries_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

We are able to control the generated image by settings exact attributes such as age, pose, expression, etc. Most approaches for manipulating GAN-generated images achieve partial control by leveraging the latent space disentanglement properties, obtained implicitly after standard GAN training. Such methods are able to change the relative intensity of certain attributes, but not explicitly set their values. Recently proposed methods, designed for explicit control over human faces, harness morphable 3D face models (3DMM) to allow fine-grained control capabilities in GANs.

Using contrastive learning, we obtain GANs with an explicitly disentangled latent space. This disentanglement is utilized to train control-encoders mapping human-interpretable inputs to suitable latent vectors, thus allowing explicit control. In the domain of human faces we demonstrate control over identity, age, pose, expression, hair color and illumination.

Relating Adversarially Robust Generalization to Flat Minima,"David Stutz, Matthias Hein, Bernt Schiele"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 7807-7817","Adversarial training (AT) has become the de-facto standard to obtain models robust against adversarial examples. However, AT exhibits severe robust overfitting: cross-entropy loss on adversarial examples, so-called robust loss, decreases continuously on training examples, while eventually increasing on test examples. In practice, this leads to poor robust generalization, i.e., adversarial robustness does not generalize well to new examples. In this paper, we study the relationship between robust generalization and flatness of the robust loss landscape in weight space, i.e., whether robust loss changes significantly when perturbing weights. To this end, we propose average- and worst-case metrics to measure flatness in the robust loss landscape and show a correlation between good robust generalization and flatness. For example, throughout training, flatness reduces significantly during overfitting such that early stopping effectively finds flatter minima in the robust loss landscape. Similarly, AT variants achieving higher adversarial robustness also correspond to flatter minima. This holds for many popular choices, e.g., AT-AWP, TRADES, MART, AT with self-supervision or additional unlabeled examples, as well as simple regularization techniques, e.g., AutoAugment, weight decay or label noise. For fair comparison across these approaches, our flatness measures are specifically designed to be scale-invariant and we conduct extensive experiments to validate our findings.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Stutz_Relating_Adversarially_Robust_Generalization_to_Flat_Minima_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

In this work, we explore the robustness of visual object trackers against motion blur from a new angle, i.e., adversarial blur attack (ABA). Our main objective is to online transfer input frames to their natural motion-blurred counterparts while misleading the state-of-the-art trackers during the tracking process. To this end, we first design the motion blur synthesizing method for visual tracking based on the generation principle of motion blur, considering the motion information and the light accumulation process. With this synthetic method, we propose optimization-based ABA (OP-ABA) by iteratively optimizing an adversarial objective function against the tracking w.r.t. the motion and light accumulation parameters. The OP-ABA is able to produce natural adversarial examples but the iteration can cause heavy time cost, making it unsuitable for attacking real-time trackers. To alleviate this issue, we further propose one-step ABA (OS-ABA) where we design and train a joint adversarial motion and accumulation predictive network (JAMANet) with the guidance of OP-ABA, which is able to efficiently estimate the adversarial motion and accumulation parameters in a one-step way.

The common practice is to first evenly divide the image into a pre-defined number of grids and then learn to associate each pixel with its surrounding grids. However, simply applying a series of convolution operations with limited receptive fields can only implicitly perceive the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids. Consequently, existing methods often fail to provide an effective context when inferring the association map. To remedy this issue, we propose a novel Association Implantation (AI) module to enable the network to explicitly capture the relations between the pixel and its surrounding grids. The proposed AI module directly implants the features of grid cells to the surrounding of its corresponding central pixel, and conducts convolution on the padded window to adaptively transfer knowledge between them. With such an implantation operation, the network could explicitly harvest the pixel-grid level context, which is more in line with the target of superpixel segmentation comparing to the pixel-wise relation. Furthermore, to pursue better boundary precision, we design a boundary-perceiving loss to help the network discriminate the pixels around boundaries in hidden feature level, which could benefit the subsequent inferring modules to accurately identify more boundary pixels.

The CE loss encourages features of a class to have a higher projection score on the true class-vector compared to the negative classes. However, this is a relative constraint and does not explicitly force different class features to be well-separated. Motivated by the observation that ground-truth class representations in CE loss are orthogonal (one-hot encoded vectors), we develop a novel loss function termed `Orthogonal Projection Loss' (OPL) which imposes orthogonality in the feature space. OPL augments the properties of CE loss and directly enforces inter-class separation alongside intra-class clustering in the feature space through orthogonality constraints on the mini-batch level. As compared to other alternatives of CE, OPL offers unique advantages e.g., no additional learnable parameters, does not require careful negative mining and is not sensitive to the batch size. Given the plug-and-play nature of OPL, we evaluate it on a diverse range of tasks including image recognition (CIFAR-100), large-scale classification (ImageNet), domain generalization (PACS) and few-shot learning (miniImageNet, CIFAR-FS, tiered-ImageNet and Meta-dataset) and demonstrate its effectiveness across the board. Furthermore, OPL offers better robustness against practical nuisances such as adversarial attacks and label noise.

To address this issue, this paper proposes to design a more complex but practical degradation model that consists of randomly shuffled blur, downsampling and noise degradations. Specifically, the blur is approximated by two convolutions with isotropic and anisotropic Gaussian kernels; the downsampling is randomly chosen from nearest, bilinear and bicubic interpolations; the noise is synthesized by adding Gaussian noise with different noise levels, adopting JPEG compression with different quality factors, and generating processed camera sensor noise via reverse-forward camera image signal processing (ISP) pipeline model and RAW image noise model.

Specifically, NAD learns to disentangle a pre-trained DNN into sub-architectures according to independent tasks, forming information flows that describe the inference processes. We investigate whether, where, and how the disentanglement occurs through experiments conducted with handcrafted and automatically-searched network architectures, on both object-based and scene-based datasets.

In this paper, we develop a simple and effective approach by combining instance-discriminative and spatially-discriminative contrastive learning. We show that when a deep network is trained to be invariant to geometric and photometric transformations, representations emerge from its intermediate layers that are highly predictive of object landmarks. Stacking these across layers in a ""hypercolumn"" and projecting them using spatially-contrastive learning further improves their performance on matching and few-shot landmark regression tasks. We also present a unified view of existing equivariant and invariant representation learning approaches through the lens of contrastive learning, shedding light on the nature of invariances learned.

We also propose the 'stochastic temporal ensemble (STE)' method for incorporating techniques to further improve DIP's performance for denoising. We additionally extend our method to Poisson noise.

Leveraging the supervision from auxiliary tasks (such as depth estimation) has the potential to heal this shift because many visual tasks are closely related to each other. However, such a supervision is not always available. In this work, we leverage the guidance from self-supervised depth estimation, which is available on both domains, to bridge the domain gap. On the one hand, we propose to explicitly learn the task feature correlation to strengthen the target semantic predictions with the help of target depth estimation. On the other hand, we use the depth prediction discrepancy from source and target depth decoders to approximate the pixel-wise adaptation difficulty. The adaptation difficulty, inferred from depth, is then used to refine the target semantic segmentation pseudo-labels. The proposed method can be easily implemented into existing segmentation frameworks.

We use a causal view---transportability theory---to identify that such loss is in fact a confounding effect, which can only be removed by causal intervention. However, the theoretical solution provided by transportability is far from practical for UDA, because it requires the stratification and representation of the unobserved confounder that is the cause of the domain gap.

We consider an occluded point to be one that is imaged in the first frame but not in the next, a slight overloading of the standard definition since it also includes points that move out-of-frame. Estimating the motion of these points is extremely difficult, particularly in the two-frame setting. Previous work relies on CNNs to learn occlusions, without much success, or requires multiple frames to reason about occlusions using temporal smoothness. In this paper, we argue that the occlusion problem can be better solved in the two-frame case by modelling image self-similarities. We introduce a global motion aggregation module, a transformer-based approach to find long-range dependencies between pixels in the first image, and perform global aggregation on the corresponding motion features.

Its constituent part, i.e., the hypersphere neuron, is obtained by applying a conformal embedding of Euclidean space. By virtue of Clifford algebra, it can be implemented as the Cartesian dot product of inputs and weights. If the embedding is applied in a manner consistent with the dimensionality of the input space geometry, the decision surfaces of the model units become combinations of hyperspheres and make the decision-making process geometrically interpretable for humans.

Motivated by this analysis, to harness the model robustness against these attacks we present an SNN training algorithm that uses crafted input noise and incurs no additional training time. To evaluate the merits of our algorithm, we conducted extensive experiments with variants of VGG and ResNet on both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets. Compared to standard trained direct input SNNs, our trained models yield improved classification accuracy of up to 13.7% and 10.1% on FGSM and PGD attack-generated images, respectively, with negligible loss in clean image accuracy. Our models also outperform inherently-robust SNNs trained on rate-coded inputs with improved or similar classification performance on attack-generated im-ages while having up to 25x and 4.6x lower latency and computation energy, respectively.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Kundu_HIRE-SNN_Harnessing_the_Inherent_Robustness_of_Energy-Efficient_Deep_Spiking_Neural_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

However, the inaccurate point assignments caused by the hand-crafted grouping scheme decrease the performance of 3D object detection. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method for directly detecting 3D objects from the 3D point cloud.

Therefore, it is urgent and vital to identify biases in AI algorithms. However, the previous bias identification pipeline overly relies on human experts to conjecture potential biases (e.g., gender), which may neglect other underlying biases not realized by humans. To help human experts better find the AI algorithms' biases, we study a new problem in this work -- for a classifier that predicts a target attribute of the input image, discover its unknown biased attribute. To solve this challenging problem, we use a hyperplane in the generative model's latent space to represent an image attribute; thus, the original problem is transformed to optimizing the hyperplane's normal vector and offset. We propose a novel total-variation loss within this framework as the objective function and a new orthogonalization penalty as a constraint. The latter prevents trivial solutions in which the discovered biased attribute is identical with the target or one of the known-biased attributes. Extensive experiments on both disentanglement datasets and real-world datasets show that our method can discover biased attributes and achieve better disentanglement w.r.t. target attributes.

To address such problems, in this paper, we explore face clustering from the pairwise angle. Specifically, we formulate the face clustering task as a pairwise relationship classification task, avoiding the memory-consuming learning on large-scale graphs. The classifier can directly determine the relationship between samples and is enhanced by taking advantage of the contextual information.

Despite the significant progress, the 'aspect' information (e.g., red eyes) contained in the text, referring to several words rather than a word that depicts 'a particular part or feature of something', is often ignored, which is highly helpful for synthesizing image details. How to make better utilization of aspect information in text-to-image synthesis still remains an unresolved challenge. To address this problem, in this paper, we propose a Dynamic Aspect-awarE GAN (DAE-GAN) that represents text information comprehensively from multiple granularities, including sentence-level, word-level, and aspect-level.

Therefore, it is a great challenge to disentangle and extract these characteristics from facial images, especially in an unsupervised manner. In this work, we introduce cycle-consistency in facial characteristics as free supervisory signal to learn facial representations from unlabeled facial images. The learning is realized by superimposing the facial motion cycle-consistency and identity cycle-consistency constraints. The main idea of the facial motion cycle-consistency is that, given a face with expression, we can perform de-expression to a neutral face via the removal of facial motion and further perform re-expression to reconstruct back to the original face. The main idea of the identity cycle-consistency is to exploit both de-identity into mean face by depriving the given neutral face of its identity via feature re-normalization and re-identity into neutral face by adding the personal attributes to the mean face. At training time, our model learns to disentangle two distinct facial representations to be useful for performing cycle-consistent face reconstruction. At test time, we use the linear protocol scheme for evaluating facial representations on various tasks, including facial expression recognition and head pose regression. We also can directly apply the learnt facial representations to person recognition, frontalization and image-to-image translation. Our experiments show that the results of our approach is competitive with those of existing methods, demonstrating the rich and unique information embedded in the disentangled representations.

For example, living rooms contain a varying number of products belonging to many possible categories and locations, e.g., a lamp may or may not be present in an endless number of possible locations. In the present work, we propose to add a ""broker"" module in Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to solve this problem. The broker is tasked to mediate the use of multiple discriminators in the appropriate image locales. For example, if a lamp is detected or wanted in a specific area of the scene, the broker assigns a fine-grained lamp discriminator to that image patch. This allows the generator to learn the shape and shading models of the lamp. The resulting multi-fine-grained optimization problem is able to synthesize complex scenes with almost the same level of photo-realism as single object images. We demonstrate the generability of the proposed approach on several GAN algorithms (BigGAN, ProGAN, StyleGAN, StyleGAN2), image resolutions (256x256 to 1024x1024), and datasets. Our approach yields significant improvements over state-of-the-art GAN algorithms.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Gadde_Detail_Me_More_Improving_GANs_Photo-Realism_of_Complex_Scenes_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Rethinking Self-Supervised Correspondence Learning: A Video Frame-Level Similarity Perspective,"Jiarui Xu, Xiaolong Wang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 10075-10085","Learning a good representation for space-time correspondence is the key for various computer vision tasks, including tracking object bounding boxes and performing video object pixel segmentation. To learn generalizable representation for correspondence in large-scale, a variety of self-supervised pretext tasks are proposed to explicitly perform object-level or patch-level similarity learning. Instead of following the previous literature, we propose to learn correspondence using Video Frame-level Similarity (VFS) learning, i.e, simply learning from comparing video frames. Our work is inspired by the recent success in image-level contrastive learning and similarity learning for visual recognition. Our hypothesis is that if the representation is good for recognition, it requires the convolutional features to find correspondence between similar objects or parts.

They own outstanding advantages compared with traditional cameras: higher temporal resolution, higher dynamic range, and lower power consumption. However, the spatial resolution of existing event cameras is insufficient and challenging to be enhanced at the hardware level while maintaining the asynchronous philosophy of circuit design. Therefore, it is imperative to explore the algorithm of event stream super-resolution, which is a non-trivial task due to the sparsity and strong spatio-temporal correlation of the events from an event camera. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end framework based on spiking neural network for event stream super-resolution, which can generate high-resolution (HR) event stream from the input low-resolution (LR) event stream. A spatiotemporal constraint learning mechanism is proposed to learn the spatial and temporal distributions of the event stream simultaneously. We validate our method on four large-scale datasets and the results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance. The satisfying results on two downstream applications, i.e. object classification and image reconstruction, further demonstrate the usability of our method.

The embedding is jointly trained with an adversarial network as a primitive discriminator to decide whether points are from the same primitive instance in local neighborhoods. Such local supervision encourages the learned embedding and discriminator to describe local surface properties and robustly distinguish different instances. At inference time, network predictions are followed by a region growing method to finalize the segmentation.

However, when used in video inpainting that requires fine-grained representation, existed method still suffers from yielding blurry edges in detail due to the hard patch splitting. Here we aim to tackle this problem by proposing FuseFormer, a Transformer model designed for video inpainting via fine-grained feature fusion based on novel Soft Split and Soft Composition operations. The soft split divides feature map into many patches with given overlapping interval. On the contrary, the soft composition operates by stitching different patches into a whole feature map where pixels in overlapping regions are summed up. These two modules are first used in tokenization before Transformer layers and de-tokenization after Transformer layers, for effective mapping between tokens and features. Therefore, sub-patch level information interaction is enabled for more effective feature propagation between neighboring patches, resulting in synthesizing vivid content for hole regions in videos. Moreover, in FuseFormer, we elaborately insert the soft composition and soft split into the feed-forward network, enabling the 1D linear layers to have the capability of modelling 2D structure. And, the sub-patch level feature fusion ability is further enhanced. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our proposed FuseFormer surpasses state-of-the-art methods.

FASA does not require any elaborate loss design, and removes the need for inter-class transfer learning that often involves large cost and manually-defined head/tail class groups.

However, the existing deep learning-based methods encounter a common issue of a large number of parameters, which leads to the deep learning models with high time complexity and low fusion efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a novel discrete Tchebichef moment-based Deep neural network, termed as DTMNet, for multi-focus image fusion. The proposed DTMNet is an end-to-end deep neural network with only one convolutional layer and three fully connected layers. The convolutional layer is fixed with DTM coefficients (DTMConv) to extract high/low-frequency information without learning parameters effectively.

To avoid these additional costs, we propose an end-to-end Interactive Prototype Learning (IPL) framework to learn better active object representations by leveraging the motion cues from the actor. First, we introduce a set of verb prototypes to disentangle active object features from distracting object features. Each prototype corresponds to a primary motion pattern of an egocentric action, offering a distinctive supervision signal for active object feature learning. Second, we design two interactive operations to enable the extraction of active object features, i.e., noun-to-verb assignment and verb-to-noun selection. These operations are parameter-efficient and can learn judicious location-aware features on top of 3D CNN backbones. We demonstrate that the IPL framework can generalize to different backbones and outperform the state-of-the-art on three large-scale egocentric video datasets, i.e., EPIC-KITCHENS-55, EPIC-KITCHENS-100 and EGTEA.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wang_Interactive_Prototype_Learning_for_Egocentric_Action_Recognition_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

Bias Loss for Mobile Neural Networks,"Lusine Abrahamyan, Valentin Ziatchin, Yiming Chen, Nikos Deligiannis"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 6556-6566","Compact convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have witnessed exceptional improvements in performance in recent years. However, they still fail to provide the same predictive power as CNNs with a large number of parameters. The diverse and even abundant features captured by the layers is an important characteristic of these successful CNNs. However, differences in this characteristic between large CNNs and their compact counterparts have rarely been investigated. In compact CNNs, due to the limited number of parameters, abundant features are unlikely to be obtained, and feature diversity becomes an essential characteristic. Diverse features present in the activation maps derived from a data point during model inference may indicate the presence of a set of unique descriptors necessary to distinguish between objects of different classes. In contrast, data points with low feature diversity may not provide a sufficient amount of unique descriptors to make a valid prediction; we refer to them as random predictions. Random predictions can negatively impact the optimization process and harm the final performance. This paper proposes addressing the problem raised by random predictions by reshaping the standard cross-entropy to make it biased toward data points with a limited number of unique descriptive features. Our novel Bias Loss focuses the training on a set of valuable data points and prevents the vast number of samples with poor learning features from misleading the optimization process. Furthermore, to show the importance of diversity, we present a family of SkipblockNet models whose architectures are brought to boost the number of unique descriptors in the last layers. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed loss function over the cross-entropy loss. Moreover, our SkipblockNet-M can achieve 1% higher classification accuracy than MobileNetV3 Large with similar computational cost on the ImageNet ILSVRC-2012 classification dataset.

Visual Scene Graphs for Audio Source Separation,"Moitreya Chatterjee, Jonathan Le Roux, Narendra Ahuja, Anoop Cherian"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 1204-1213","State-of-the-art approaches for visually-guided audio source separation typically assume sources that have characteristic sounds, such as musical instruments. These approaches often ignore the visual context of these sound sources or avoid modeling object interactions that may be useful to better characterize the sources, especially when the same object class may produce varied sounds from distinct interactions. To address this challenging problem, we propose Audio Visual Scene Graph Segmenter (AVSGS), a novel deep learning model that embeds the visual structure of the scene as a graph and segments this graph into subgraphs, each subgraph being associated with a unique sound obtained by co-segmenting the audio spectrogram. At its core, AVSGS uses a recursive neural network that emits mutually-orthogonal sub-graph embeddings of the visual graph using multi-head attention. These embeddings are used for conditioning an audio encoder-decoder towards source separation. Our pipeline is trained end-to-end via a self-supervised task consisting of separating audio sources using the visual graph from artificially mixed sounds. In this paper, we also introduce an """"in the wild"" video dataset for sound source separation that contains multiple non-musical sources, which we call Audio Separation in the Wild (ASIW). This dataset is adapted from the AudioCaps dataset, and provides a challenging, natural, and daily-life setting for source separation.

In computer vision applications, generative counterfactual methods indicate how to perturb a model's input to change its prediction, providing details about the model's decision-making. Current methods tend to generate trivial counterfactuals about a model's decisions, as they often suggest to exaggerate or remove the presence of the attribute being classified. For the machine learning practitioner, these types of counterfactuals offer little value, since they provide no new information about undesired model or data biases. In this work, we identify the problem of trivial counterfactual generation and we propose DiVE to alleviate it. DiVE learns a perturbation in a disentangled latent space that is constrained using a diversity-enforcing loss to uncover multiple valuable explanations about the model's prediction.

The neural predictors can directly estimate the performance without any training of the DNNs to be evaluated, thus have drawn increasing attention from researchers. Despite their popularity, they also suffer a severe limitation: the shortage of annotated DNN architectures for effectively training the neural predictors. In this paper, we proposed Homogeneous Architecture Augmentation for Neural Predictor (HAAP) of DNN architectures to address the issue aforementioned. Specifically, a homogeneous architecture augmentation algorithm is proposed in HAAP to generate sufficient training data taking the use of homogeneous representation. Furthermore, the one-hot encoding strategy is introduced into HAAP to make the representation of DNN architectures more effective. The experiments have been conducted on both NAS-Benchmark-101 and NAS-Bench-201 dataset.

Prior methods perform refinement by feeding zoomed-in input and rendered RGB images into a CNN and directly regressing an update of a refined pose. Their runtime is slow due to the computational cost of CNN, which is especially prominent in multiple-object pose refinement. To overcome this problem, RePOSE leverages image rendering for fast feature extraction using a 3D model with a learnable texture. We call this deep texture rendering, which uses a shallow multi-layer perceptron to directly regress a view-invariant image representation of an object. Furthermore, we utilize differentiable Levenberg-Marquard (LM) optimization to refine a pose fast and accurately by minimizing the feature-metric error between the input and rendered image representations without the need of zooming in. These image representations are trained such that differentiable LM optimization converges within few iterations. Consequently, RePOSE runs at 92 FPS and achieves state-of-the-art accuracy of 51.6% on the Occlusion LineMOD dataset - a 4.1% absolute improvement over the prior art, and comparable result on the YCB-Video dataset with a much faster runtime.

One potential reason for this unexpected result is that all losses let the network focus on similar image regions or properties. In this paper, we investigate this by conducting a two-step analysis to extract and compare the learned visual features of the same model architecture trained with different loss functions: First, we compare the learned features on the pixel level by correlating saliency maps of the same input images. Second, we compare the clustering of embeddings for several image properties, e.g. object color or illumination. To provide independent control over these properties, photo-realistic 3D car renders similar to images in the Cars196 dataset are generated.

In this paper, we study knowledge distillation(KD) to effectively compress a transformer-based large VL model into a small VL model. The major challenge arises from the inconsistent regional visual tokens extracted from different detectors of Teacher and Student, resulting in the misalignment of hidden representations and attention distributions. To address the problem, we retrain and adapt the Teacher by using the same region proposals from Student's detector while the features are from Teacher's own object detector. With aligned network inputs, the adapted Teacher is capable of transferring the knowledge through the intermediate representations.

Unsupervised Learning of Fine Structure Generation for 3D Point Clouds by 2D Projections Matching,"Chao Chen, Zhizhong Han, Yu-Shen Liu, Matthias Zwicker"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 12466-12477","Learning to generate 3D point clouds without 3D supervision is an important but challenging problem. Current solutions leverage various differentiable renderers to project the generated 3D point clouds onto a 2D image plane, and train deep neural networks using the per-pixel difference with 2D ground truth images. However, these solutions are still struggling to fully recover fine structures of 3D shapes, such as thin tubes or planes. To resolve this issue, we propose an unsupervised approach for 3D point cloud generation with fine structures. Specifically, we cast 3D point cloud learning as a 2D projection matching problem. Rather than using entire 2D silhouette images as a regular pixel supervision, we introduce structure adaptive sampling to randomly sample 2D points within the silhouettes as an irregular point supervision, which alleviates the consistency issue of sampling from different view angles. Our method pushes the neural network to generate a 3D point cloud whose 2D projections match the irregular point supervision from different view angles. Our 2D projection matching approach enables the neural network to learn more accurate structure information than using the per-pixel difference, especially for fine and thin 3D structures. Our method can recover fine 3D structures from 2D silhouette images at different resolutions, and is robust to different sampling methods and point number in irregular point supervision. Our method outperforms others under widely used benchmarks.

The main challenge of the problem is the catastrophic forgetting, and for the exemplar-memory based CIL methods, it is generally known that the forgetting is commonly caused by the classification score bias that is injected due to the data imbalance between the new classes and the old classes (in the exemplar-memory). While several methods have been proposed to correct such score bias by some additional post-processing, e.g., score re-scaling or balanced fine-tuning, no systematic analysis on the root cause of such bias has been done. To that end, we analyze that computing the softmax probabilities by combining the output scores for all old and new classes could be the main cause of the bias. Then, we propose a new CIL method, dubbed as Separated Softmax for Incremental Learning (SS-IL), that consists of separated softmax (SS) output layer combined with task-wise knowledge distillation (TKD) to resolve such bias. Throughout our extensive experimental results on several large-scale CIL benchmark datasets, we show our SS-IL achieves strong state-of-the-art accuracy through attaining much more balanced prediction scores across old and new classes, without any additional post-processing.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Ahn_SS-IL_Separated_Softmax_for_Incremental_Learning_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

Despite promising progress, existing representations learned with neural networks still struggle to generalize in closed-loop predictions (e.g., output colliding trajectories). This issue largely arises from the non-i.i.d. nature of sequential prediction in conjunction with ill-distributed training data. Intuitively, if the training data only comes from human behaviors in safe spaces, i.e., from ""positive"" examples, it is difficult for learning algorithms to capture the notion of ""negative"" examples like collisions.

However, existing deep blind methods usually directly reconstruct the image without predicting the quality factor, thus lacking the flexibility to control the output as the non-blind methods. To remedy this problem, in this paper, we propose a flexible blind convolutional neural network, namely FBCNN, that can predict the adjustable quality factor to control the trade-off between artifacts removal and details preservation. Specifically, FBCNN decouples the quality factor from the JPEG image via a decoupler module and then embeds the predicted quality factor into the subsequent reconstructor module through a quality factor attention block for flexible control. Besides, we find existing methods are prone to fail on non-aligned double JPEG images even with only a one-pixel shift, and we thus propose a double JPEG degradation model to augment the training data.

To alleviate the constraint of few samples, enhancing the generalization ability of learned features for novel objects plays a key role. Thus, the feature learning process of FSOD should focus more on intrinsical object characteristics, which are invariant under different visual changes and therefore are helpful for feature generalization. Unlike previous attempts of the meta-learning paradigm, in this paper, we explore how to enhance object features with intrinsical characteristics that are universal across different object categories. We propose a new prototype, namely universal prototype, that is learned from all object categories. Besides the advantage of characterizing invariant characteristics, the universal prototypes alleviate the impact of unbalanced object categories. After enhancing object features with the universal prototypes, we impose a consistency loss to maximize the agreement between the enhanced features and the original ones, which is beneficial for learning invariant object characteristics. Thus, we develop a new framework of few-shot object detection with universal prototypes ( FSOD ^ up ) that owns the merit of feature generalization towards novel objects.

Explainable Person Re-Identification With Attribute-Guided Metric Distillation,"Xiaodong Chen, Xinchen Liu, Wu Liu, Xiao-Ping Zhang, Yongdong Zhang, Tao Mei"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 11813-11822","Despite the great progress of person re-identification (ReID) with the adoption of Convolutional Neural Networks, current ReID models are opaque and only outputs a scalar distance between two persons. There are few methods providing users semantically understandable explanations for why two persons are the same one or not. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc method, named Attribute-guided Metric Distillation (AMD), to explain existing ReID models. This is the first method to explore attributes to answer: 1) what and where the attributes make two persons different, and 2) how much each attribute contributes to the difference. In AMD, we design a pluggable interpreter network for target models to generate quantitative contributions of attributes and visualize accurate attention maps of the most discriminative attributes. To achieve this goal, we propose a metric distillation loss by which the interpreter learns to decompose the distance of two persons into components of attributes with knowledge distilled from the target model. Moreover, we propose an attribute prior loss to make the interpreter generate attribute-guided attention maps and to eliminate biases caused by the imbalanced distribution of attributes.

In this paper, we ask the question: how important is the motion particularly for self-supervised video representation learning. To this end, we compose a duet of exploiting the motion for data augmentation and feature learning in the regime of contrastive learning. Specifically, we present a Motion-focused Contrastive Learning (MCL) method that regards such duet as the foundation. On one hand, MCL capitalizes on optical flow of each frame in a video to temporally and spatially sample the tubelets (i.e., sequences of associated frame patches across time) as data augmentations. On the other hand, MCL further aligns gradient maps of the convolutional layers to optical flow maps from spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal perspectives, in order to ground motion information in feature learning. Extensive experiments conducted on R(2+1)D backbone demonstrate the effectiveness of our MCL. On UCF101, the linear classifier trained on the representations learnt by MCL achieves 81.91% top-1 accuracy, outperforming ImageNet supervised pre-training by 6.78%.

Super-Resolving Cross-Domain Face Miniatures by Peeking at One-Shot Exemplar,"Peike Li, Xin Yu, Yi Yang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 4469-4479","Conventional face super-resolution methods usually assume testing low-resolution (LR) images lie in the same domain as the training ones. Due to different lighting conditions and imaging hardware, domain gaps between training and testing images inevitably occur in many real-world scenarios. Neglecting those domain gaps would lead to inferior face super-resolution (FSR) performance. However, how to transfer a trained FSR model to a target domain efficiently and effectively has not been investigated. To tackle this problem, we develop a Domain-Aware Pyramid-based Face Super-Resolution network, named DAP-FSR network. Our DAP-FSR is the first attempt to super-resolve LR faces from a target domain by exploiting only a pair of high-resolution (HR) and LR exemplar in the target domain. To be specific, our DAP-FSR firstly employs its encoder to extract the multi-scale latent representations of the input LR face. Considering only one target domain example is available, we propose to augment the target domain data by mixing the latent representations of the target domain face and source domain ones and then feed the mixed representations to the decoder of our DAP-FSR. The decoder will generate new face images resembling the target domain image style. The generated HR faces in turn are used to optimize our decoder to reduce the domain gap. By iteratively updating the latent representations and our decoder, our DAP-FSR will be adapted to the target domain, thus achieving authentic and high-quality upsampled HR faces.

While promising, they have the shortcomings that (1) the second step is not supervised by the main objective of instance segmentation, and (2) their point-wise feature learning and grouping are less effective to deal with data irregularities, possibly resulting in fragmented segmentations. To address these issues, we propose in this work an end-to-end solution of Semantic Superpoint Tree Network (SSTNet) for proposing object instances from scene points. Key in SSTNet is an intermediate, semantic superpoint tree (SST), which is constructed based on the learned semantic features of superpoints, and which will be traversed and split at intermediate tree nodes for proposals of object instances.

Partially supervised instance segmentation aims to improve mask prediction with limited mask labels by utilizing the more abundant weak box labels. In this work, we show that a class agnostic mask head, commonly used in partially supervised instance segmentation, has difficulties learning a general concept of foreground for the weakly annotated classes using box supervision only. To resolve this problem, we introduce an object mask prior (OMP) that provides the mask head with the general concept of foreground implicitly learned by the box classification head under the supervision of all classes. This helps the class agnostic mask head to focus on the primary object in a region of interest (RoI) and improves generalization to the weakly annotated classes.

Existing 4D-CT reconstructions are designed for sparse sampling schemes that require fast CT scanners to capture multiple, rapid revolutions around the scene in order to generate high quality results. However, if the scene is moving too fast, then the sampling occurs along a limited view and is difficult to reconstruct due to spatiotemporal ambiguities. In this work, we design a reconstruction pipeline using implicit neural representations coupled with a novel parametric motion field warping to perform limited view 4D-CT reconstruction of rapidly deforming scenes. Importantly, we utilize a differentiable analysis-by-synthesis approach to compare with captured x-ray sinogram data in a self-supervised fashion. Thus, our resulting optimization method requires no training data to reconstruct the scene. We demonstrate that our proposed system robustly reconstructs scenes containing deformable and periodic motion and validate against state-of-the-art baselines.

Therefore, the representations obtained by deep learning outperform hand-crafted features significantly.

However, some commonly-used loss functions, such as Cross Entropy (CE), always suffer from severe overfitting to noisy labels. Although robust loss functions have been designed, they often encounter underfitting. In this paper, we theoretically prove that any loss will be robust to noisy labels when restricting the output of a network to the set of permutations over any fixed vector. When the fixed vector is one-hot, we only need to constrain the output to be one-hot, which means a discrete image and thus zero gradients almost everywhere. This prohibits gradient-based learning of models. In this work, we introduce two sparse regularization strategies to approximate the one-hot constraint: output sharpening and l_p-norm (p\le 1). Output sharpening directly modifies the output distribution of a network to be sharp by adjusting the ""temperature"" parameter. l_p-norm plays the role of a regularization term to make the output to be sparse. These two simple strategies guarantee the robustness of arbitrary loss functions while not hindering the fitting ability of networks.

Such methods, however, have limited ability to capture rich contextual dependencies among points. In this paper, we leverage the high-quality region proposal network and a Channel-wise Transformer architecture to constitute our two-stage 3D object detection framework (CT3D) with minimal hand-crafted design. The proposed CT3D simultaneously performs proposal-aware embedding and channel-wise context aggregation for the point features within each proposal. Specifically, CT3D uses proposal's keypoints for spatial contextual modelling and learns attention propagation in the encoding module, mapping the proposal to point embeddings. Next, a new channel-wise decoding module enriches the query-key interaction via channel-wise re-weighting to effectively merge multi-level contexts, which contributes to more accurate object predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our CT3D method has superior performance and excellent scalability. Remarkably, CT3D achieves the AP of 81.77% in the moderate car category on the KITTI test 3D detection benchmark, outperforms state-of-the-art 3D detectors.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Sheng_Improving_3D_Object_Detection_With_Channel-Wise_Transformer_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

However, the role of stationary versus non-stationary attributes is less explored: Stationary features, which remain similar throughout the video, enable the prediction of video-level action classes. Non-stationary features, which represent temporally varying attributes, are more beneficial for downstream tasks involving more fine-grained temporal understanding, such as action segmentation. We argue that a single representation to capture both types of features is sub-optimal, and propose to decompose the representation space into stationary and non-stationary features via contrastive learning from long and short views, i.e. long video sequences and their shorter sub-sequences. Stationary features are shared between the short and long views, while non-stationary features aggregate the short views to match the corresponding long view. To empirically verify our approach, we demonstrate that our stationary features work particularly well on an action recognition downstream task, while our non-stationary features perform better on action segmentation.

This is motivated by the observation that for a video-text pair, the content words in the text, such as nouns and verbs, are more likely to be aligned with the visual contents in the video than the function words. Second, a cascade sampling method is applied to generate a small set of hard negative examples for efficient loss estimation for multi-modal fusion layers.

It can be seamlessly integrated into existing augmentation operations without modifying the network, consistently improving the robustness against color variations. Incorporated with a random erasing strategy, it further greatly enriches the diversity by simulating random occlusions.

Previous correspondence matching based methods require the inputs to have distinctive geometric structures to fit a 3D rigid transformation according to point-wise sparse feature matches. However, the accuracy of transformation heavily relies on the quality of extracted features, which are prone to errors with respect to partiality and noise. In addition, they can not utilize the geometric knowledge of all the overlapping regions. On the other hand, previous global feature based approaches can utilize the entire point cloud for the registration, however they ignore the negative effect of non-overlapping points when aggregating global features. In this paper, we present OMNet, a global feature based iterative network for partial-to-partial point cloud registration. We learn overlapping masks to reject non-overlapping regions, which converts the partial-to-partial registration to the registration of the same shape. Moreover, the previously used data is sampled only once from the CAD models for each object, resulting in the same point clouds for the source and reference. We propose a more practical manner of data generation where a CAD model is sampled twice for the source and reference, avoiding the previously prevalent over-fitting issue.

We make the initial attempt to explore the defense strategy on semantic segmentation by formulating a general adversarial training procedure that can perform decently on both adversarial and clean samples. We propose a dynamic divide-and-conquer adversarial training (DDC-AT) strategy to enhance the defense effect, by setting additional branches in the target model during training, and dealing with pixels with diverse properties towards adversarial perturbation. Our dynamical division mechanism divides pixels into multiple branches automatically. Note all these additional branches can be abandoned during inference and thus leave no extra parameter and computation cost. Extensive experiments with various segmentation models are conducted on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets, in which DDC-AT yields satisfying performance under both white- and black-box attack.

Without access to data, conventional data-driven model compression faces a higher risk of performance degradation. Recently, some works propose to generate images from a specific pretrained model to serve as training data. However, the inversion process only utilizes biased feature statistics stored in one model and is from low-dimension to high-dimension. As a consequence, it inevitably encounters the difficulties of generalizability and inexact inversion, which leads to unsatisfactory performance. To address these problems, we propose MixMix based on two simple yet effective techniques: (1) Feature Mixing: utilizes various models to construct a universal feature space for generalized inversion; (2) Data Mixing: mixes the synthesized images and labels to generate exact label information. We prove the effectiveness of MixMix from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. Extensive experiments show that MixMix outperforms existing methods on the mainstream compression tasks, including quantization, knowledge distillation and pruning.

One promising technique to obtain an accurate yet lightweight pose estimator is knowledge distillation, which distills the pose knowledge from a powerful teacher model to a less-parameterized student model. However, existing pose distillation works rely on a heavy pre-trained estimator to perform knowledge transfer and require a complex two-stage learning procedure. In this work, we investigate a novel Online Knowledge Distillation framework by distilling Human Pose structure knowledge in a one-stage manner to guarantee the distillation efficiency, termed OKDHP. Specifically, OKDHP trains a single multi-branch network and acquires the predicted heatmaps from each, which are then assembled by a Feature Aggregation Unit (FAU) as the target heatmaps to teach each branch in reverse. Instead of simply averaging the heatmaps, FAU which consists of multiple parallel transformations with different receptive fields, leverages the multi-scale information, thus obtains target heatmaps with higher-quality. Specifically, the pixel-wise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is utilized to minimize the discrepancy between the target heatmaps and the predicted ones, which enables the student network to learn the implicit keypoint relationship. Besides, an unbalanced OKDHP scheme is introduced to customize the student networks with different compression rates.

Several approaches exist, yet at large scale we face a combinatorial explosion of possible solutions and state-of-the-art methods like RANSAC, Hough transform or Branch&Bound require a minimum inlier ratio or prior knowledge to remain practical. In fact, for problems such as camera posing in very large scenes these approaches become useless as they have exponential runtime growth if these conditions aren't met.

Specifically, a novel Intrinsic-Extrinsic Preserved Generative Adversarial Network (IEP-GAN) is presented for both intrinsic (i.e., shape) and extrinsic (i.e., pose) information preservation.

Multi-echo measurement can provide information about object contours and semi-transparent surfaces which can be used to better identify and locate objects. LiDAR can also measure surface reflectance (intensity of laser pulse return), as well as ambient light of the scene (sunlight reflected by objects).

(2) shape ambiguity (i.e., the lack of shape constraints on body configuration).

This leads to slow convergence when training BNNs. In this paper, for the first time, we explore the influence of ""dead weights"" which refer to a group of weights that are barely updated during the training of BNNs, and then introduce rectified clamp unit (ReCU) to revive the ""dead weights"" for updating.

Nevertheless, the existing foreground selection strategies have a major limitation of only considering the unilateral relation from foreground to actions, which cannot guarantee the foreground-action consistency. In this paper, we present a framework named FAC-Net based on the I3D backbone, on which three branches are appended, named class-wise foreground classification branch, class-agnostic attention branch and multiple instance learning branch.

Besides, the class-agnostic attention branch and multiple instance learning branch are adopted to regularize the foreground-action consistency and help to learn a meaningful foreground classifier. Within each branch, we introduce a hybrid attention mechanism, which calculates multiple attention scores for each snippet, to focus on both discriminative and less-discriminative snippets to capture the full action boundaries.

The main idea during training is that each subnetwork learns to classify only one of the multiple inputs simultaneously provided. However, the question of how to best mix these multiple inputs has not been studied so far. In this paper, we introduce MixMo, a new generalized framework for learning multi-input multi-output deep subnetworks. Our key motivation is to replace the suboptimal summing operation hidden in previous approaches by a more appropriate mixing mechanism. For that purpose, we draw inspiration from successful mixed sample data augmentations. We show that binary mixing in features - particularly with rectangular patches from CutMix - enhances results by making subnetworks stronger and more diverse. We improve state of the art for image classification on CIFAR-100 and Tiny ImageNet datasets. Our easy to implement models notably outperform data augmented deep ensembles, without the inference and memory overheads.

Though effective, translating the full feature map can be costly due to redundant computation on some area like the background. In this work, we encapsulate the idea of reducing spatial redundancy into a novel poll and pool (PnP) sampling module, with which we build an end-to-end PnP-DETR architecture that adaptively allocates its computation spatially to be more efficient. Concretely, the PnP module abstracts the image feature map into fine foreground object feature vectors and a small number of coarse background contextual feature vectors. The transformer models information interaction within the fine-coarse feature space and translates the features into the detection result. Moreover, the PnP-augmented model can instantly achieve various desired trade-offs between performance and computation with a single model by varying the sampled feature length, without requiring to train multiple models as existing methods. Thus it offers greater flexibility for deployment in diverse scenarios with varying computation constraint. We further validate the generalizability of the PnP module on panoptic segmentation and the recent transformer-based image recognition model ViT and show consistent efficiency gain. We believe our method makes a step for efficient visual analysis with transformers, wherein spatial redundancy is commonly observed.

Specifically, we represent the geometric structures as line segments and conduct the network with three main components: (i) context and line segments encoders, (ii) a structure-guided plane decoder, (iii) a pixel-wise plane embedding decoder. Given an image and its detected line segments, PlaneTR generates the context and line segment sequences via two specially designed encoders and then feeds them into a Transformers-based decoder to directly predict a sequence of plane instances by simultaneously considering the context and global structure cues.

DCT-SNN: Using DCT To Distribute Spatial Information Over Time for Low-Latency Spiking Neural Networks,"Isha Garg, Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury, Kaushik Roy"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 4671-4680","Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative to traditional deep learning frameworks, since they provide higher computational efficiency due to event-driven information processing. SNNs distribute the analog values of pixel intensities into binary spikes over time. However, the most widely used input coding schemes, such as Poisson based rate-coding, do not leverage the additional temporal learning capability of SNNs effectively. Moreover, these SNNs suffer from high inference latency which is a major bottleneck to their deployment. To overcome this, we propose a time-based encoding scheme that utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to reduce the number of timesteps required for inference. DCT decomposes an image into a weighted sum of sinusoidal basis images. At each time step, a single frequency base, taken in order and modulated by its corresponding DCT coefficient, is input to an accumulator that generates spikes upon crossing a threshold. We use the proposed scheme to learn DCT-SNN, a low-latency deep SNN with leaky-integrate-and-fire neurons, trained using surrogate gradient descent based backpropagation. We achieve top-1 accuracy of 89.94%, 68.3% and 52.43% on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively using VGG architectures. Notably, DCT-SNN performs inference with 2-14X reduced latency compared to other state-of-the-art SNNs, while achieving comparable accuracy to their standard deep learning counterparts. The dimension of the transform allows us to control the number of timesteps required for inference.

Learning To Resize Images for Computer Vision Tasks,"Hossein Talebi, Peyman Milanfar"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 497-506","For all the ways convolutional neural nets have revolutionized computer vision in recent years, one important aspect has received surprisingly little attention: the effect of image size on the accuracy of tasks being trained for. Typically, to be efficient, the input images are resized to a relatively small spatial resolution (e.g. 224x224), and both training and inference are carried out at this resolution. The actual mechanism for this re-scaling has been an afterthought: Namely, off-the-shelf image resizers such as bilinear and bicubic are commonly used in most machine learning software frameworks. But do these resizers limit the on task performance of the trained networks? The answer is yes. Indeed, we show that the typical linear resizer can be replaced with learned resizers that can substantially improve performance. Importantly, while the classical resizers typically result in better perceptual quality of the downscaled images, our proposed learned resizers do not necessarily give better visual quality, but instead improve task performance. Our learned image resizer is jointly trained with a baseline vision model. This learned CNN-based resizer creates machine friendly visual manipulations that lead to a consistent improvement of the end task metric over the baseline model. Specifically, here we focus on the classification task with the ImageNet dataset, and experiment with four different models to learn resizers adapted to each model. Moreover, we show that the proposed resizer can also be useful for fine-tuning the classification baselines for other vision tasks. To this end, we experiment with three different baselines to develop image quality assessment (IQA) models on the AVA dataset.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Talebi_Learning_To_Resize_Images_for_Computer_Vision_Tasks_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

To address these challenges, we develop a new Unsupervised Dense Deformation Embedding Network (i.e., UD2E-Net), which learns to predict deformations between non-rigid shapes from dense local features.

While some researchers have demonstrated that Transformer-based models enjoy a favorable ability of fitting data, there are still growing number of evidences showing that these models suffer over-fitting especially when the training data is limited. This paper offers an empirical study by performing step-by-step operations to gradually transit a Transformer-based model to a convolution-based model. The results we obtain during the transition process deliver useful messages for improving visual recognition. Based on these observations, we propose a new architecture named Visformer, which is abbreviated from the 'Vision-friendly Transformer'. With the same computational complexity, Visformer outperforms both the Transformer-based and convolution-based models in terms of ImageNet classification accuracy, and the advantage becomes more significant when the model complexity is lower or the training set is smaller.

Most existing methods formulate the task as image-to-image translation, ignoring the 3D properties of the scene. However, indoor scenes contain complex 3D light transport where a 2D representation is insufficient. In this paper, we propose a unified, learning-based inverse rendering framework that formulates 3D spatially-varying lighting. Inspired by classic volume rendering techniques, we propose a novel Volumetric Spherical Gaussian representation for lighting, which parameterizes the exitant radiance of the 3D scene surfaces on a voxel grid. We design a physicsbased differentiable renderer that utilizes our 3D lighting representation, and formulates the energy-conserving image formation process that enables joint training of all intrinsic properties with the re-rendering constraint. Our model ensures physically correct predictions and avoids the need for ground-truth HDR lighting which is not easily accessible.

We conduct a large-scale transfer learning study which tests different ImageNet backbones, always using the same read out architecture and learning protocol adopted from DeepGaze II. By replacing the VGG19 backbone of DeepGaze II with ResNet50 features we improve the performance on saliency prediction from 78% to 85%.

A forward model of the world supervises a driving policy that predicts the outcome of any potential driving trajectory. To support learning from pre-recorded logs, we assume that the world is on rails, meaning neither the agent nor its actions influence the environment. This assumption greatly simplifies the learning problem, factorizing the dynamics into a nonreactive world model and a low-dimensional and compact forward model of the ego-vehicle. Our approach computes action-values for each training trajectory using a tabular dynamic-programming evaluation of the Bellman equations; these action-values in turn supervise the final vision-based driving policy.

Animatable Neural Radiance Fields for Modeling Dynamic Human Bodies,"Sida Peng, Junting Dong, Qianqian Wang, Shangzhan Zhang, Qing Shuai, Xiaowei Zhou, Hujun Bao"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 14314-14323","This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing an animatable human model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce neural blend weight fields to produce the deformation fields. Based on the skeleton-driven deformation, blend weight fields are used with 3D human skeletons to generate observation-to-canonical and canonical-to-observation correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can regularize the learning of deformation fields. Moreover, the learned blend weight fields can be combined with input skeletal motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the human model. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent human synthesis methods.

OpenGAN: Open-Set Recognition via Open Data Generation,"Shu Kong, Deva Ramanan"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 813-822","Real-world machine learning systems need to analyze novel testing data that differs from the training data. In K-way classification, this is crisply formulated as open-set recognition, core to which is the ability to discriminate open-set data outside the K closed-set classes. Two conceptually elegant ideas for open-set discrimination are: 1) discriminatively learning an open-vs-closed binary discriminator by exploiting some outlier data as the open-set, and 2) unsupervised learning the closed-set data distribution with a GAN and using its discriminator as the open-set likelihood function. However, the former generalizes poorly to diverse open test data due to overfitting to the training outliers, which unlikely exhaustively span the open-world. The latter does not work well, presumably due to the instable training of GANs. Motivated by the above, we propose OpenGAN, which addresses the limitation of each approach by combining them with several technical insights. First, we show that a carefully selected GAN-discriminator on some real outlier data already achieves the state-of-the-art. Second, we augment the available set of real open training examples with adversarially synthesized """"fake"""" data. Third and most importantly, we build the discriminator over the features computed by the closed-world K-way networks.

One significant challenge in this line of research is access to DP data. Despite many cameras having DP sensors, only a limited number provide access to the low-level DP sensor images. In addition, capturing training data for defocus deblurring involves a time-consuming and tedious setup requiring the camera's aperture to be adjusted. Some cameras with DP sensors (e.g., smartphones) do not have adjustable apertures, further limiting the ability to produce the necessary training data. We address the data capture bottleneck by proposing a procedure to generate realistic DP data synthetically. Our synthesis approach mimics the optical image formation found on DP sensors and can be applied to virtual scenes rendered with standard computer software. Leveraging these realistic synthetic DP images, we introduce a recurrent convolutional network (RCN) architecture that improves deblurring results and is suitable for use with single-frame and multi-frame data (e.g., video) captured by DP sensors.

Our key idea is to adopt a self-supervised learning strategy to train a novel encoder-decoder, named TravelNet, whose training motion data is prepared by the physics engine using discrete pose states. TravelNet captures key pose states from hand motion sequences as compact motion descriptors, inspired by the concept of keyframes in animation. Finally, it manages to extract those key states out of perturbations without manual annotations, and reconstruct the motions preserving details and physical plausibility.

This is because such models solely depend on visual information for text recognition, thus lacking semantic reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we argue that semantic information offers a complementary role in addition to visual only. More specifically, we additionally utilize semantic information by proposing a multi-stage multi-scale attentional decoder that performs joint visual-semantic reasoning. Our novelty lies in the intuition that for text recognition, prediction should be refined in a stage-wise manner. Therefore our key contribution is in designing a stage-wise unrolling attentional decoder where non-differentiability, invoked by discretely predicted character labels, needs to be bypassed for end-to-end training. While the first stage predicts using visual features, subsequent stages refine on-top of it using joint visual-semantic information.

Existing WSOD methods take various techniques to pursue single ""high-quality"" pseudo label from low-cost annotations and then develop their saliency networks. Though these methods have achieved good performance, the generated single label is inevitably affected by adopted refinement algorithms and shows prejudiced characteristics which further influence the saliency networks. In this work, we introduce a new multiple-pseudo label framework to integrate more comprehensive and accurate saliency cues from multiple labels, avoiding the aforementioned problem. Specifically, we propose a multi-filer directive network (MFNet) including a saliency network as well as multiple directive filters. The directive filter (DF) is designed to extract and filter more accurate saliency cues from the noisy pseudo labels. The multiple accurate cues from multiple DFs are then simultaneously propagated to the saliency network with a multi-guidance loss. Extensive experiments on five datasets over four metrics demonstrate that our method outperforms all the existing congeneric methods.

On the Importance of Distractors for Few-Shot Classification,"Rajshekhar Das, Yu-Xiong Wang, José M. F. Moura"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 9030-9040","Few-shot classification aims at classifying categories of a novel task by learning from just a few (typically, 1 to 5) labeled examples. An effective approach to few-shot classification involves a prior model trained on a large-sample base domain, which is then finetuned over the novel few-shot task to yield generalizable representations. However, task-specific finetuning is prone to overfitting due to the lack of enough training examples. To alleviate this issue, we propose a new finetuning approach based on contrastive learning that reuses unlabelled examples from the base domain in the form of distractors. Unlike the nature of unlabelled data used in prior works, distractors belong to classes that do not overlap with the novel categories. We demonstrate for the first time that the inclusion of such distractors can significantly boost few-shot generalization. Our technical novelty includes a stochastic pairing of examples sharing the same category in the few-shot task and a weighting term that controls the relative influence of task-specific negatives and distractors. An important aspect of our finetuning objective is that it is agnostic to distractor labels and hence applicable to various base domain settings. More precisely, compared to state-of-the-art approaches, our method shows accuracy gains of up to 12% in cross-domain and up to 5% in unsupervised prior-learning settings.

The key idea is to implicitly embed those previously dropped information into the halftone patterns. So, the halftone pattern not only serves to reproduce the image tone, maintain the blue-noise randomness, but also represents the color information and fine details. To this end, we exploit two collaborative convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the dithering scheme, under a non-trivial self-supervision formulation. To tackle the flatness degradation issue of CNNs, we propose a novel noise incentive block (NIB) that can serve as a generic CNN plug-in for performance promotion.

Generally, a scene graph prefers to be an omniscient ""generalist"", while the image caption is more willing to be a ""specialist"", which outlines the gist. Lots of previous studies have found that a scene graph is not as practical as expected unless it can reduce the trivial contents and noises. In this respect, the image caption is a good tutor. To this end, we let the scene graph borrow the ability from the image caption so that it can be a specialist on the basis of remaining all-around, resulting in the so-called Topic Scene Graph. What an image caption pays attention to is distilled and passed to the scene graph for estimating the importance of partial objects, relationships, and events. Specifically, during the caption generation, the attention about individual objects in each time step is collected, pooled, and assembled to obtain the attention about relationships, which serves as weak supervision for regularizing the estimated importance scores of relationships. In addition, as this attention distillation process provides an opportunity for combining the generation of image caption and scene graph together, we further transform the scene graph into linguistic form with rich and free-form expressions by sharing a single generation model with image caption. Experiments show that attention distillation brings significant improvements in mining important relationships without strong supervision, and the topic scene graph shows great potential in subsequent applications.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wang_Topic_Scene_Graph_Generation_by_Attention_Distillation_From_Caption_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

This happens because deep CNNs trained with the de facto cross-entropy loss can easily overfit to small amounts of labeled data. To address this issue, we propose a simple and effective contrastive learning-based training strategy in which we first pretrain the network using a pixel-wise, label-based contrastive loss, and then fine-tune it using the cross-entropy loss.

In this paper, we handle the critical issue, slow training convergence, and present a conditional cross-attention mechanism for fast DETR training. Our approach is motivated by that the cross-attention in DETR relies highly on the content embeddings for localizing the four extremities and predicting the box, which increases the need for high-quality content embeddings and thus the training difficulty. Our approach, named conditional DETR, learns a conditional spatial query from the decoder embedding for decoder multi-head cross-attention. The benefit is that through the conditional spatial query, each cross-attention head is able to attend to a band containing a distinct region, e.g., one object extremity or a region inside the object box. This narrows down the spatial range for localizing the distinct regions for object classification and box regression, thus relaxing the dependence on the content embeddings and easing the training. Empirical results show that conditional DETR converges 6.7x faster for the backbones R50 and R101 and 10x faster for stronger backbones DC5-R50 and DC5-R101.

Differently, our GNeRF only utilizes randomly initialized poses for complex outside-in scenarios. We propose a novel two-phases end-to-end framework. The first phase takes the use of GANs into the new realm for optimizing coarse camera poses and radiance fields jointly, while the second phase refines them with additional photometric loss. We overcome local minima using a hybrid and iterative optimization scheme. Extensive experiments on a variety of synthetic and natural scenes demonstrate the effectiveness of GNeRF.

Popular hand-designed activation functions like Rectified Linear Unit(ReLU) and its variants show promising performance in various tasks and models. Swish, the automatically discovered activation function, outperforms ReLU on many challenging datasets. However, it has two main drawbacks. First, the tree-based search space is highly discrete and restricted, making it difficult to searching. Second, the sample-based searching method is inefficient, making it infeasible to find specialized activation functions for each dataset or neural architecture. To tackle these drawbacks, we propose a new activation function called Piecewise Linear Unit(PWLU), which incorporates a carefully designed formulation and learning method.

Moreover, using the fixed model at test time does not account for the fact that a pair of images may require their own prior, thus providing limited performance and poor generalization to unseen images.

In this paper we propose MDETR, an end-to-end modulated detector that detects objects in an image conditioned on a raw text query, like a caption or a question.

We address the partially supervised instance segmentation problem in which one can train on (significantly cheaper) bounding boxes for all categories but use masks only for a subset of categories. In this work, we focus on a popular family of models which apply differentiable cropping to a feature map and predict a mask based on the resulting crop. Under this family, we study Mask R-CNN and discover that instead of its default strategy of training the mask-head with a combination of proposals and groundtruth boxes, training the mask-head with only groundtruth boxes dramatically improves its performance on novel classes. This training strategy also allows us to take advantage of alternative mask-head architectures, which we exploit by replacing the typical mask-head of 2-4 layers with significantly deeper off-the-shelf architectures (e.g. ResNet, Hourglass models). While many of these architectures perform similarly when trained in fully supervised mode, our main finding is that they can generalize to novel classes in dramatically different ways. We call this ability of mask-heads to generalize to unseen classes the strong mask generalization effect and show that without any specialty modules or losses, we can achieve state-of-the-art results in the partially supervised COCO instance segmentation benchmark.

Due to the lack of supervision signals for the correspondence between missing regions and known regions, it may fail to find proper reference features, which often leads to artifacts in the results. Also, it computes pair-wise similarity across the entire feature map during inference bringing a significant computational overhead.

Causal Attention for Unbiased Visual Recognition,"Tan Wang, Chang Zhou, Qianru Sun, Hanwang Zhang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 3091-3100","Attention module does not always help deep models learn causal features that are robust in any confounding context, e.g., a foreground object feature is invariant to different backgrounds. This is because the confounders trick the attention to capture spurious correlations that benefit the prediction when the training and testing data are IID (identical & independent distribution); while harm the prediction when the data are OOD (out-of-distribution). The sole fundamental solution to learn causal attention is by causal intervention, which requires additional annotations of the confounders, e.g., a ""dog"" model is learned within ""grass+dog"" and ""road+dog"" respectively, so the ""grass"" and ""road"" contexts will no longer confound the ""dog"" recognition. However, such annotation is not only prohibitively expensive, but also inherently problematic, as the confounders are elusive in nature. In this paper, we propose a causal attention module (CaaM) that self-annotates the confounders in unsupervised fashion. In particular, multiple CaaMs can be stacked and integrated in conventional attention CNN and self-attention Vision Transformer. In OOD settings, deep models with CaaM outperform those without it significantly; even in IID settings, the attention localization is also improved by CaaM, showing a great potential in applications that require robust visual saliency.

It measures the data credibility by the loss distribution of pseudo-labels, which is synthetical considered multi-tasks. Specifically, pseudo-labeled data of different tasks are mapped to a unified metric space by mean of the pseudo-loss model, making it possible to learn the prior pseudo-loss distribution.

However, as most DL architectures are designed to directly learn pixel-level mapping relationships, they largely ignore semantic-level information and lack sufficient interpretability. To address the above issues, in this work, we propose an interpretable deep network to learn both pixel-level regressive prior and semantic-level discriminative prior. Specifically, we design a variational model to formulate the image de-blocking problem and propose two prior terms for the image content and gradient, respectively. The content-relevant prior is formulated as a DL-based image-to-image regressor to perform as a de-blocker from the pixel-level. The gradient-relevant prior serves as a DL-based classifier to distinguish whether the image is compressed from the semantic-level. To effectively solve the variational model, we design an alternating minimization algorithm and unfold it into a deep network architecture. In this way, not only the interpretability of the deep network is increased, but also the dual priors can be well estimated from training samples. By integrating the two priors into a single framework, the image de-blocking problem can be well-constrained, leading to a better performance.

FATNN: Fast and Accurate Ternary Neural Networks,"Peng Chen, Bohan Zhuang, Chunhua Shen"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 5219-5228","Ternary Neural Networks (TNNs) have received much attention due to being potentially orders of magnitude faster in inference, as well as more power efficient, than full-precision counterparts. However, 2 bits are required to encode the ternary representation with only 3 quantization levels leveraged. As a result, conventional TNNs have similar memory consumption and speed compared with the standard 2-bit models, but have worse representational capability. Moreover, there is still a significant gap in accuracy between TNNs and full-precision networks, hampering their deployment to real applications. To tackle these two challenges, in this work, we first show that, under some mild constraints, computational complexity of the ternary inner product can be reduced by 2x. Second, to mitigate the performance gap, we elaborately design an implementation-dependent ternary quantization algorithm. The proposed framework is termed Fast and Accurate Ternary Neural Networks (FATNN). Experiments on image classification demonstrate that our FATNN surpasses the state-of-the-arts by a significant margin in accuracy. More importantly, speedup evaluation compared with various precisions is analyzed on several platforms, which serves as a strong benchmark for further research.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Chen_FATNN_Fast_and_Accurate_Ternary_Neural_Networks_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Multitask AET With Orthogonal Tangent Regularity for Dark Object Detection,"Ziteng Cui, Guo-Jun Qi, Lin Gu, Shaodi You, Zenghui Zhang, Tatsuya Harada"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 2553-2562","Dark environment becomes a challenge for computer vision algorithms owing to insufficient photons and undesirable noises. Most of the existing studies tackle this by either targeting human vision for better visual perception or improving the machine vision for specific high-level tasks. In addition, these methods rely on data argumentation and directly train their models based on real-world or over-simplified synthetic datasets without exploring the intrinsic pattern behind illumination translation. Here, we propose a novel multitask auto encoding transformation (MAET) model that combines human vision and machine vision tasks to enhance object detection in a dark environment. With a self-supervision learning, the MAET learns an intrinsic visual structure by encoding and decoding the realistic illumination-degrading transformation considering the physical noise model and image signal processing (ISP). Based on this representation, we achieve object detection task by decoding the bounding box coordinates and classes. To avoid the over-entanglement of two tasks, our MAET disentangles the object and degrading features by imposing an orthogonal tangent regularity. This forms a parametric manifold along which multitask predictions can be geometrically formulated by maximizing the orthogonality between the tangents along the outputs of respective tasks. Our framework can be implemented based on the mainstream object detection architecture and directly trained end-to-end using the normal target detection datasets, such as COCO and VOC.

Collaborative Unsupervised Visual Representation Learning From Decentralized Data,"Weiming Zhuang, Xin Gan, Yonggang Wen, Shuai Zhang, Shuai Yi"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 4912-4921","Unsupervised representation learning has achieved outstanding performances using centralized data available on the Internet. However, the increasing awareness of privacy protection limits sharing of decentralized unlabeled image data that grows explosively in multiple parties (e.g. mobile phones and cameras). As such, a natural problem is how to leverage these data to learn visual representations for downstream tasks while preserving data privacy. To address this problem, we propose a novel federated unsupervised learning framework, FedU. In this framework, each party trains models from unlabeled data independently using contrastive learning with an online network and a target network. Then, a central server aggregates trained models and updates clients' models with the aggregated global model. It preserves data privacy as each party only has access to its raw data. Decentralized data among multiple parties is normally non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), which leads to performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose two simple but effective methods: (1) We design the communication protocol to upload only the encoders of online networks for server aggregation and update them with the aggregated encoder. (2) We introduce a new module to dynamically decide how to update the predictors based on the degree of divergence caused by non-IID. The predictor is the other component of the online network. Extensive experiments and ablations demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of FedU. It outperforms training with only one party by over 5% and other methods by over 14% in linear and semi-supervised evaluation on non-IID data.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhuang_Collaborative_Unsupervised_Visual_Representation_Learning_From_Decentralized_Data_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

The point cloud is partial as it is obtained by a depth sensor capturing only the visible part of the object from a certain viewpoint. It introduces two main challenges: 1) two partial point clouds do not fully overlap and 2) keypoints tend to be less reliable when the visible part of the object does not have salient local structures. To address these issues, we propose DeepPRO, a keypoint-free and an end-to-end trainable deep neural network. Its core idea is inspired by how humans align two point clouds: we can imagine how two point clouds will look like after the registration based on their shape. To realize the idea, DeepPRO has inputs of two partial point clouds and directly predicts the point-wise location of the aligned point cloud. By preserving the ordering of points during the prediction, we enjoy dense correspondences between input and predicted point clouds when inferring rigid transform parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on the real-world Linemod and synthetic ModelNet40 datasets. In addition, we collect and evaluate on the PRO1k dataset, a large-scale version of Linemod meant to test generalization to real-world scans.

We tackle these issues by recreating no longer available data for the old classes and outlining a content inpainting scheme on the background class. We propose two sources for replay data. The first resorts to a generative adversarial network to sample from the class space of past learning steps. The second relies on web-crawled data to retrieve images containing examples of old classes from online databases.

Such decentralized training naturally leads to issues of imbalanced or differing data distributions among the local models and challenges in fusing them into a central model. Existing FL methods deal with these issues by either sharing local parameters or fusing models via online distillation. However, such a design leads to multiple rounds of inter-node communication resulting in substantial bandwidth consumption, while also increasing the risk of data leakage and consequent privacy issues. To address these problems, we propose a new distillation-based FL framework that can preserve privacy by design, while also consuming substantially less network communication resources when compared to the current state-of-the-art. Our framework engages in inter-node communication using only publicly available and approved datasets, thereby giving explicit privacy control to the user. To distill knowledge among the various local models, our framework involves a novel ensemble distillation algorithm that uses both final prediction as well as model attention. This algorithm explicitly considers the diversity among various local nodes while also seeking consensus among them. This results in a comprehensive technique to distill knowledge from various decentralized nodes.

In this paper, we resolve the problem by introducing a Transformer-based architecture that enables long-range relationships between voxels by self-attention. Given the fact that non-empty voxels are naturally sparse but numerous, directly applying standard Transformer on voxels is non-trivial. To this end, we propose the sparse voxel module and the submanifold voxel module, which can operate on the empty and non-empty voxel positions effectively. To further enlarge the attention range while maintaining comparable computational overhead to the convolutional counterparts, we propose two attention mechanisms for multi-head attention in those two modules: Local Attention and Dilated Attention, and we further propose Fast Voxel Query to accelerate the querying process in multi-head attention. VoTr contains a series of sparse and submanifold voxel modules and can be applied in most voxel-based detectors.

Out-of-Boundary View Synthesis Towards Full-Frame Video Stabilization,"Yufei Xu, Jing Zhang, Dacheng Tao"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 4842-4851","Warping-based video stabilizers smooth camera trajectory by constraining each pixel's displacement and warp stabilized frames from unstable ones accordingly. However, since the view outside the boundary is not available during warping, the resulting holes around the boundary of the stabilized frame must be discarded (i.e., cropping) to maintain visual consistency, and thus does leads to a tradeoff between stability and cropping ratio. In this paper, we make a first attempt to address this issue by proposing a new Out-of-boundary View Synthesis (OVS) method. By the nature of spatial coherence between adjacent frames and within each frame, OVS extrapolates the out-of-boundary view by aligning adjacent frames to each reference one. Technically, it first calculates the optical flow and propagates it to the outer boundary region according to the affinity, and then warps pixels accordingly. OVS can be integrated into existing warping-based stabilizers as a plug-and-play pre-processing module to significantly improve the cropping ratio of the stabilized results. In addition, stability is improved because the jitter amplification effect caused by cropping and resizing is reduced. Experimental results on the NUS benchmark show that OVS can improve the performance of five representative state-of-the-art methods in terms of objective metrics and subjective visual quality.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Xu_Out-of-Boundary_View_Synthesis_Towards_Full-Frame_Video_Stabilization_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

However, the severe color inconsistency makes it very challenging to generate well-aligned training pairs of input raw and target sRGB images. While learning with inaccurately aligned supervision is prone to causing pixel shift and producing blurry results. In this paper, we circumvent such issue by presenting a joint learning model for image alignment and RAW-to-sRGB mapping. To diminish the effect of color inconsistency in image alignment, we introduce to use a global color mapping (GCM) module to generate an initial sRGB image given the input raw image, which can keep the spatial location of the pixels unchanged, and the target sRGB image is utilized to guide GCM for converting the color towards it. Then a pre-trained optical flow estimation network (e.g., PWC-Net) is deployed to warp the target sRGB image to align with the GCM output. To alleviate the effect of inaccurately aligned supervision, the warped target sRGB image is leveraged to learn RAW-to-sRGB mapping. When training is done, the GCM module and optical flow network can be detached, thereby bringing no extra computation cost for inference. Experiments show that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-arts on ZRR and SR-RAW datasets.

To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a novel semantics disentangling framework for the generalized zero-shot learning task (SDGZSL), where the visual features depicted unseen classes are firstly estimated by a conditional VAE and then factorized into semantic-consistent and semantic-unrelated latent vectors. In particular, a total correlation penalty is applied to guarantee the independence between the two factorized representations, and the semantic consistency of which is measured by the derived relation network. Extensive experiments conducted on four GZSL benchmark datasets have evidenced that the semantic-consistent features disentangled by the proposed SDGZSL are more generalizable in tasks of canonical and generalized zero-shot learning.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Chen_Semantics_Disentangling_for_Generalized_Zero-Shot_Learning_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Space-Time-Separable Graph Convolutional Network for Pose Forecasting,"Theodoros Sofianos, Alessio Sampieri, Luca Franco, Fabio Galasso"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 11209-11218","Human pose forecasting is a complex structured-data sequence-modelling task, which has received increasing attention, also due to numerous potential applications. Research has mainly addressed the temporal dimension as time series and the interaction of human body joints with a kinematic tree or by a graph. This has decoupled the two aspects and leveraged progress from the relevant fields, but it has also limited the understanding of the complex structural joint spatio-temporal dynamics of the human pose. Here we propose a novel Space-Time-Separable Graph Convolutional Network (STS-GCN) for pose forecasting. For the first time, STS-GCN models the human pose dynamics only with a graph convolutional network (GCN), including the temporal evolution and the spatial joint interaction within a single-graph framework, which allows the cross-talk of motion and spatial correlations. Concurrently, STS-GCN is the first space-time-separable GCN: the space-time graph connectivity is factored into space and time affinity matrices, which bottlenecks the space-time cross-talk, while enabling full joint-joint and time-time correlations. Both affinity matrices are learnt end-to-end, which results in connections substantially deviating from the standard kinematic tree and the linear-time time series. In experimental evaluation on three complex, recent and large-scale benchmarks, Human3.6M [Ionescu et al. TPAMI'14], AMASS [Mahmood et al. ICCV'19] and 3DPW [Von Marcard et al. ECCV'18], STS-GCN outperforms the state-of-the-art, surpassing the current best technique [Mao et al. ECCV'20] by over 32% in average at the most difficult long-term predictions, while only requiring 1.7% of its parameters. We explain the results qualitatively and illustrate the graph interactions by the factored joint-joint and time-time learnt graph connections.

However, MAML and its variants often resort to a simple loss function without any auxiliary loss function or regularization terms that can help achieve better generalization. The problem lies in that each application and task may require different auxiliary loss function, especially when tasks are diverse and distinct. Instead of attempting to hand-design an auxiliary loss function for each application and task, we introduce a new meta-learning framework with a loss function that adapts to each task.

Previous works usually implement deep models to train an agent to predict actions in real-time. However, in the unseen environment, when the target object is not in egocentric view, the agent may not be able to make wise decisions due to the lack of guidance. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical object-to-zone (HOZ) graph to guide the agent in a coarse-to-fine manner, and an online-learning mechanism is also proposed to update HOZ according to the real-time observation in new environments. In particular, the HOZ graph is composed of scene nodes, zone nodes and object nodes. With the pre-learned HOZ graph, the real-time observation and the target goal, the agent can constantly plan an optimal path from zone to zone. In the estimated path, the next potential zone is regarded as sub-goal, which is also fed into the deep reinforcement learning model for action prediction.

Here we adopt an information-theoretic approach to identify and resolve the potential adverse effect of the multiple domain discriminators on MDA: disintegration of domain-discriminative information, limited computational scalability, and a large variance in the gradient of the loss during training. We examine the above issues by situating adversarial DA in the context of information regularization. This also provides a theoretical justification for using a single and unified domain discriminator.

Until now, the community has largely focused on road extraction, where road networks are inferred from scratch from an aerial image. However, given that relatively high-quality maps exist in most parts of the world, in practice, inference approaches must be applied to update existing maps rather than infer new ones. With recent road extraction methods showing high accuracy, we argue that it is time to transition to the more practical map update task, where an existing map is updated by adding, removing, and shifting roads, without introducing errors in parts of the existing map that remain up-to-date. In this paper, we develop a new dataset called MUNO21 for the map update task, and show that it poses several new and interesting research challenges.

The RGB-D SLAM approach relies heavily on the accuracy of the input depth map. However, refraction and reflection of transparent objects will result in false depth input of RGB-D cameras, which makes the traditional RGB-D SLAM algorithm unable to work correctly in the presence of transparent objects. In this paper, we propose a novel SLAM approach called transfusion that allows transparent object existence and recovery in the video input. Our method is composed of two parts. Transparent Objects Cut Iterative Closest Points (TC-ICP)is first used to recover camera pose, detecting and removing transparent objects from input to reduce the trajectory errors. Then Transparent Objects Reconstruction (TO-Reconstruction) is used to reconstruct the transparent objects and opaque objects separately. The opaque objects are reconstructed with the traditional method, and the transparent objects are reconstructed with the visual hull-based method. To evaluate our algorithm, we construct a new RGB-D SLAM database containing 25 video sequences. Each sequence has at least one transparent object. Experiments show that our approach can work adequately in scenes contain transparent objects while the existing approach can not handle them.

However, such an assumption is rarely applicable for real images whose blur kernels are usually spatially variant due to factors such as object motion and out-of-focus. Hence, existing blind SR methods would inevitably give rise to poor performance in real applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes a mutual affine network (MANet) for spatially variant kernel estimation. Specifically, MANet has two distinctive features. First, it has a moderate receptive field so as to keep the locality of degradation. Second, it involves a new mutual affine convolution (MAConv) layer that enhances feature expressiveness without increasing receptive field, model size and computation burden. This is made possible through exploiting channel interdependence, which applies each channel split with an affine transformation module whose input are the rest channel splits.

Specifically, when choosing the Chebyshev graph filter, a unified formulation can be derived for explaining and analyzing the existing nonlocal-based blocks (e.g., nonlocal block, nonlocal stage, double attention block). Furthermore, by concerning the property of spectral, we propose an efficient and robust spectral nonlocal block, which can be more robust and flexible to catch long-range dependencies when inserted into deep neural networks than the existing nonlocal blocks.

Black"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 11138-11147","Synthesizing images of a person in novel poses from a single image is a highly ambiguous task. Most existing approaches require paired training images; i.e. images of the same person with the same clothing in different poses. However, obtaining sufficiently large datasets with paired data is challenging and costly. Previous methods that forego paired supervision lack realism. We propose a self-supervised framework named SPICE (Self-supervised Person Image CrEation) that closes the image quality gap with supervised methods. The key insight enabling self-supervision is to exploit 3D information about the human body in several ways. First, the 3D body shape must remain unchanged when reposing. Second, representing body pose in 3D enables reasoning about self occlusions. Third, 3D body parts that are visible before and after reposing, should have similar appearance features. Once trained, SPICE takes an image of a person and generates a new image of that person in a new target pose. SPICE achieves state-of-the-art performance on the DeepFashion dataset, improving the FID score from 29.9 to 7.8 compared with previous unsupervised methods, and with performance similar to the state-of-the-art supervised method (6.4). SPICE also generates temporally coherent videos given an input image and a sequence of poses, despite being trained on static images only.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Sanyal_Learning_Realistic_Human_Reposing_Using_Cyclic_Self-Supervision_With_3D_Shape_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

This task is challenging because 3D scenes exhibit diverse patterns, ranging from continuous ones, such as object sizes and the relative poses between pairs of shapes, to discrete patterns, such as occurrence and co-occurrence of objects with symmetrical relationships. This paper introduces a novel neural scene synthesis approach that can capture diverse feature patterns of 3D scenes. Our method combines the strength of both neural network-based and conventional scene synthesis approaches. We use the parametric prior distributions learned from training data, which provide uncertainties of object attributes and relative attributes, to regularize the outputs of feed-forward neural models.

Existing universal style transfer methods successfully deliver arbitrary styles to original images either in an artistic or a photo-realistic way.

Specifically, the degrees of content preservation and stylization are established according to a predefined target domain.

A common practice is to start from a large perturbation and then iteratively reduce it with a deterministic direction and a random one while keeping it adversarial. The limited information obtained from each query and inefficient direction sampling impede attack efficiency, making it hard to obtain a small enough perturbation within a limited number of queries. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel attack method termed Adaptive History-driven Attack (AHA) which gathers information from all historical queries as the prior for current sampling.

Anonymizing Egocentric Videos,"Daksh Thapar, Aditya Nigam, Chetan Arora"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 2320-2329","In egocentric videos, the face of a wearer capturing the video is never captured. This gives a false sense of security that the wearer's privacy is preserved while sharing such videos. However, egocentric cameras are typically harnessed to wearer's head, and hence, also capture wearer's gait. Recent works have shown that wearer gait signatures can be extracted from egocentric videos, which can be used to determine if two egocentric videos have the same wearer. In a more damaging scenario, one can even recognize a wearer using hand gestures from egocentric videos, or identify a wearer in third person videos such as from a surveillance camera. We believe, this could be a death knell in sharing of egocentric videos, and fatal for egocentric vision research. In this work, we suggest a novel technique to anonymize egocentric videos, which create carefully crafted, but small, and imperceptible optical flow perturbations in an egocentric video's frames. Importantly, these perturbations do not affect object detection or action/activity recognition from egocentric videos but are strong enough to dis-balance the gait recovery process.

Modulated Graph Convolutional Network for 3D Human Pose Estimation,"Zhiming Zou, Wei Tang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 11477-11487","The graph convolutional network (GCN) has recently achieved promising performance of 3D human pose estimation (HPE) by modeling the relationship among body parts. However, most prior GCN approaches suffer from two main drawbacks. First, they share a feature transformation for each node within a graph convolution layer. This prevents them from learning different relations between different body joints. Second, the graph is usually defined according to the human skeleton and is suboptimal because human activities often exhibit motion patterns beyond the natural connections of body joints. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Modulated GCN for 3D HPE. It consists of two main components: weight modulation and affinity modulation. Weight modulation learns different modulation vectors for different nodes so that the feature transformations of different nodes are disentangled while retaining a small model size. Affinity modulation adjusts the graph structure in a GCN so that it can model additional edges beyond the human skeleton. We investigate several affinity modulation methods as well as the impact of regularizations. Rigorous ablation study indicates both types of modulation improve performance with negligible overhead. Compared with state-of-the-art GCNs for 3D HPE, our approach either significantly reduces the estimation errors, e.g., by around 10%, while retaining a small model size or drastically reduces the model size, e.g., from 4.22M to 0.29M (a 14.5 X reduction), while achieving comparable performance.

Our framework (1) adopts the ordinary classifier to notify the regions to be erased and (2) generates a class-specific mask for erasing by randomly sampling a single specific class to be erased (target class) among the existing classes on the image for obtaining more precise CAMs. Specifically, with the guidance of the ordinary classifier, the proposed CAMs Generation Network (CGNet) is enforced to generate a CAM of the target class while constraining the CAM not to intrude the object regions of the other classes. Along with the pseudo-labels refined from our CAMs, we achieve the state-of-the-art WSSS performance on both PASCAL VOC 2012 and MS-COCO dataset only with image-level supervision.

Sparse-to-Dense Feature Matching: Intra and Inter Domain Cross-Modal Learning in Domain Adaptation for 3D Semantic Segmentation,"Duo Peng, Yinjie Lei, Wen Li, Pingping Zhang, Yulan Guo"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 7108-7117","Domain adaptation is critical for success when confronting with the lack of annotations in a new domain. As the huge time consumption of labeling process on 3D point cloud, domain adaptation for 3D semantic segmentation is of great expectation. With the rise of multi-modal datasets, large amount of 2D images are accessible besides 3D point clouds. In light of this, we propose to further leverage 2D data for 3D domain adaptation by intra and inter domain cross modal learning. As for intra-domain cross modal learning, most existing works sample the dense 2D pixel-wise features into the same size with sparse 3D point-wise features, resulting in the abandon of numerous useful 2D features. To address this problem, we propose Dynamic sparse-to-dense Cross Modal Learning (DsCML) to increase the sufficiency of multi-modality information interaction for domain adaptation. For inter-domain cross modal learning, we further advance Cross Modal Adversarial Learning (CMAL) on 2D and 3D data which contains different semantic content aiming to promote high-level modal complementarity. We evaluate our model under various multi-modality domain adaptation settings including day-to-night, country-to-country and dataset-to-dataset, brings large improvements over both uni-modal and multi-modal domain adaptation methods on all settings.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Peng_Sparse-to-Dense_Feature_Matching_Intra_and_Inter_Domain_Cross-Modal_Learning_in_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

To address this issue, we propose injecting explicit positional encoding at each scale of the generator.

The research field to solve this problem is called domain generalization, and it alleviates the domain shift problem by extracting domain-invariant features explicitly or implicitly. In recent studies, contrastive learning-based domain generalization approaches have been proposed and achieved high performance. These approaches require sampling of the negative data pair.

Recently, SeFa tries to find latent disentangled directions by performing SVD on the first projection of a pre-trained GAN. However, it is only applied to the first layer and works in a post-processing way. Hessian Penalty minimizes the off-diagonal entries of the output's Hessian matrix to facilitate disentanglement, and can be applied to multi-layers. However, it constrains each entry of output independently, making it not sufficient in disentangling the latent directions (e.g., shape, size, rotation, etc.) of spatially correlated variations. In this paper, we propose a simple Orthogonal Jacobian Regularization (OroJaR) to encourage deep generative model to learn disentangled representations. It simply encourages the variation of output caused by perturbations on different latent dimensions to be orthogonal, and the Jacobian with respect to the input is calculated to represent this variation. We show that our OroJaR also encourages the output's Hessian matrix to be diagonal in an indirect manner. In contrast to the Hessian Penalty, our OroJaR constrains the output in a holistic way, making it very effective in disentangling latent dimensions corresponding to spatially correlated variations.

Specifically, we present a simple but effective local feature representation, called sorted Gram matrix(SGM), which is not only invariant to arbitrary rotations, but also models the pair-wise relationship of all the points in a neighborhood. In more detail, we utilize vector inner product to model distance- and angle-information between two points, and in a local patch it naturally forms a Gram matrix. In order to guarantee permutation invariance, we sort the correlation value in Gram matrix for each point, therefore this geometric feature names sorted Gram matrix. Furthermore, we mathematically prove that the Gram matrix is rotation-invariant and sufficient to model the inherent structure of a point cloud patch. We then use SGM as features in convolution, which can be readily integrated as a drop-in module into any point-based networks. Finally, we evaluated the proposed method on two widely used datasets, and it outperforms previous state-of-the-arts on both shape classification and part segmentation tasks by a large margin.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Xu_SGMNet_Learning_Rotation-Invariant_Point_Cloud_Representations_via_Sorted_Gram_Matrix_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Instance-Wise Hard Negative Example Generation for Contrastive Learning in Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation,"Weilun Wang, Wengang Zhou, Jianmin Bao, Dong Chen, Houqiang Li"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 14020-14029","Contrastive learning shows great potential in unpaired image-to-image translation, but sometimes the translated results are in poor quality and the contents are not preserved consistently. In this paper, we uncover that the negative examples play a critical role in the performance of contrastive learning for image translation. The negative examples in previous methods are randomly sampled from the patches of different positions in the source image, which are not effective to push the positive examples close to the query examples. To address this issue, we present instance-wise hard Negative Example Generation for Contrastive learning in Unpaired image-to-image Translation (NEGCUT). Specifically, we train a generator to produce negative examples online. The generator is novel from two perspectives: 1) it is instance-wise which means that the generated examples are based on the input image, and 2) it can generate hard negative examples since it is trained with an adversarial loss. With the generator, the performance of unpaired image-to-image translation is significantly improved.

Such a multi-target adaptation is crucial for a variety of scenarios that real-world autonomous systems must handle. It is a challenging set-up since one faces not only the domain gap between the labeled source set and the unlabeled target set, but also the distribution shifts existing within the latter among the different target domains. To this end, we introduce two adversarial frameworks: (i) multi-discriminator, which explicitly aligns each target domain to its counterparts, and (ii) multi-target knowledge transfer, which learns a target-agnostic model thanks to a multi-teacher/single-student distillation mechanism.

In this task, the model needs to detect objects and predict visual relationships between them. Most of the existing models predict relationships in parallel assuming their independence. While there are differ- ent ways to capture these dependencies, we explore a conditional approach motivated by the sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) formalism. Different from the previous research, our proposed model predicts visual relationships one at a time in an autoregressive manner by explicitly conditioning on the already predicted relationships. Drawing from translation models in NLP, we propose an encoder- decoder model built using Transformers where the encoder captures global context and long range interactions. The decoder then makes sequential predictions by conditioning on the scene graph constructed so far. In addition, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning-based training strategy tailored to Seq2Seq scene graph generation. By using a self-critical policy gradient training approach with Monte Carlo search we directly optimize for the (mean) recall metrics and bridge the gap between training and evaluation.

Such attacks can make models perform abnormally on inputs with predefined triggers and still retain state-of-the-art performance on clean data. While backdoor attacks have been thoroughly investigated in the image domain from both attackers' and defenders' sides, an analysis in the frequency domain has been missing thus far. This paper first revisits existing backdoor triggers from a frequency perspective and performs a comprehensive analysis. Our results show that many current backdoor attacks exhibit severe high-frequency artifacts, which persist across different datasets and resolutions. We further demonstrate these high-frequency artifacts enable a simple way to detect existing backdoor triggers at a detection rate of 98.50% without prior knowledge of the attack details and the target model. Acknowledging previous attacks' weaknesses, we propose a practical way to create smooth backdoor triggers without high-frequency artifacts and study their detectability. We show that existing defense works can benefit by incorporating these smooth triggers into their design consideration. Moreover, we show that the detector tuned over stronger smooth triggers can generalize well to unseen weak smooth triggers.

In view of this, we present Voxel-Mesh Network (VMNet), a novel 3D deep architecture that operates on the voxel and mesh representations leveraging both the Euclidean and geodesic information. Intuitively, the Euclidean information extracted from voxels can offer contextual cues representing interactions between nearby objects, while the geodesic information extracted from meshes can help separate objects that are spatially close but have disconnected surfaces.

Specifically, to relieve the negative influence of disturbing terms (illumination, etc.), we partition the information of day and night image pairs into two complementary sub-spaces: private and invariant domains, where the former contains the unique information (illumination, etc.) of day and night images and the latter contains essential shared information (texture, etc.). Meanwhile, to guarantee that the day and night images contain the same information, the domain-separated network takes the day-time images and corresponding night-time images (generated by GAN) as input, and the private and invariant feature extractors are learned by orthogonality and similarity loss, where the domain gap can be alleviated, thus better depth maps can be expected. Meanwhile, the reconstruction and photometric losses are utilized to estimate complementary information and depth maps effectively.

Discriminative Region-Based Multi-Label Zero-Shot Learning,"Sanath Narayan, Akshita Gupta, Salman Khan, Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Ling Shao, Mubarak Shah"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 8731-8740","Multi-label zero-shot learning (ZSL) is a more realistic counter-part of standard single-label ZSL since several objects can co-exist in a natural image. However, the occurrence of multiple objects complicates the reasoning and requires region-specific processing of visual features to preserve their contextual cues. We note that the best existing multi-label ZSL method takes a shared approach towards attending to region features with a common set of attention maps for all the classes. Such shared maps lead to diffused attention, which does not discriminatively focus on relevant locations when the number of classes are large. Moreover, mapping spatially-pooled visual features to the class semantics leads to inter-class feature entanglement, thus hampering the classification. Here, we propose an alternate approach towards region-based discriminability-preserving multi-label zero-shot classification. Our approach maintains the spatial resolution to preserve region-level characteristics and utilizes a bi-level attention module (BiAM) to enrich the features by incorporating both region and scene context information. The enriched region-level features are then mapped to the class semantics and only their class predictions are spatially pooled to obtain image-level predictions, thereby keeping the multi-class features disentangled. Our approach sets a new state of the art on two large-scale multi-label zero-shot benchmarks: NUS-WIDE and Open Images. On NUS-WIDE, our approach achieves an absolute gain of 6.9% mAP for ZSL, compared to the best published results.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Narayan_Discriminative_Region-Based_Multi-Label_Zero-Shot_Learning_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

However, the issue of feature alignment remains as neglected by most existing approaches for simplicity. Direct pixel addition between upsampled and local features leads to feature maps with misaligned contexts that, in turn, translate to mis-classifications in prediction, especially on object boundaries. In this paper, we propose a feature alignment module that learns transformation offsets of pixels to contextually align upsampled higher-level features; and another feature selection module to emphasize the lower-level features with rich spatial details. We then integrate these two modules in a top-down pyramidal architecture and present the Feature-aligned Pyramid Network (FaPN).

Specifically, we learn the latent distribution to represent different motion patterns and optimize it by contrastive discrimination. The contrastive distribution discrimination encourages latent distributions to be discriminative. Our method could be seamlessly integrated with existing multi-modal stochastic predictive models as a plug-and-play module to learn the more discriminative latent distribution.

In this paper, we study the robustness of Vision Transformers to adversarial examples. Our analyses of transformer security is divided into three parts. First, we test the transformer under standard white-box and black-box attacks. Second, we study the transferability of adversarial examples between CNNs and transformers. We show that adversarial examples do not readily transfer between CNNs and transformers. Based on this finding, we analyze the security of a simple ensemble defense of CNNs and transformers. By creating a new attack, the self-attention blended gradient attack, we show that such an ensemble is not secure under a white-box adversary.

Thus, in this work, we propose an efficient and effective hierarchical feature transformer (HiFT) for aerial tracking. Hierarchical similarity maps generated by multi-level convolutional layers are fed into the feature transformer to achieve the interactive fusion of spatial (shallow layers) and semantics cues (deep layers). Consequently, not only the global contextual information can be raised, facilitating the target search, but also our end-to-end architecture with the transformer can efficiently learn the interdependencies among multi-level features, thereby discovering a tracking-tailored feature space with strong discriminability. Comprehensive evaluations on four aerial benchmarks have proven the effectiveness of HiFT. Real-world tests on the aerial platform have strongly validated its practicability with a real-time speed.

The ViT model splits each image into a sequence of tokens with fixed length and then applies multiple Transformer layers to model their global relation for classification. However, ViT achieves inferior performance to CNNs when trained from scratch on a midsize dataset like ImageNet. We find it is because: 1) the simple tokenization of input images fails to model the important local structure such as edges and lines among neighboring pixels, leading to low training sample efficiency; 2) the redundant attention backbone design of ViT leads to limited feature richness for fixed computation budgets and limited training samples. To overcome such limitations, we propose a new Tokens-To-Token Vision Transformer (T2T-ViT), which incorporates 1) a layer-wise Tokens-to-Token (T2T) transformation to progressively structurize the image to tokens by recursively aggregating neighboring Tokens into one Token (Tokens-to-Token), such that local structure represented by surrounding tokens can be modeled and tokens length can be reduced; 2) an efficient backbone with a deep-narrow structure for vision transformer motivated by CNN architecture design after empirical study. Notably, T2T-ViT reduces the parameter count and MACs of vanilla ViT by half, while achieving more than 3.0% improvement when trained from scratch on ImageNet. It also outperforms ResNets and achieves comparable performance with MobileNets by directly training on ImageNet. For example, T2T-ViT with comparable size to ResNet50 (21.5M parameters) can achieve 83.3% top1 accuracy in image resolution 384x384 on ImageNet.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Yuan_Tokens-to-Token_ViT_Training_Vision_Transformers_From_Scratch_on_ImageNet_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

The student, which consists of two generators (one shared with the teacher) and a discriminator, learns from new RGB data with no available paired depth information, for improved generalization. The fully trained shared generator can then be used in runtime to hallucinate depth from RGB for downstream applications such as face recognition.

Previous methods, though capture context to exploit global clues, handle scene parsing as a pixel-independent task. However, it is well known that pixels in an image are highly correlated with each other, especially those from the same semantic region, while treating pixels independently fails to take advantage of such correlations. In this work, we treat each respective region in an image as a whole, and capture the structure topology as well as the affinity among different regions. To this end, we first divide the entire feature maps to different regions and extract respective global features from them. Next, we construct a directed graph whose nodes are regional features, and the edge connecting every two nodes is the affinity between the regional features they represent. After that, we transfer the affinity-aware nodes in the directed graph back to corresponding regions of the image, which helps to model the region dependencies and mitigate unrealistic results. In addition, to further boost the correlation among pixels, we propose a region-level loss that evaluates all pixels in a region as a whole and motivates the network to learn the exclusive regional feature per class.

However, a fixed architecture may not be suitable for different data with high diversity. To boost the model capacity, existing methods usually employ larger convolutional kernels or deeper network layers, which incurs prohibitive computational costs. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing Differentiable Dynamic Wirings (DDW), which learns the instance-aware connectivity that creates different wiring patterns for different instances. 1) Specifically, the network is initialized as a complete directed acyclic graph, where the nodes represent convolutional blocks and the edges represent the connection paths. 2) We generate edge weights by a learnable module, Router, and select the edges whose weights are larger than a threshold, to adjust the connectivity of the neural network structure. 3) Instead of using the same path of the network, DDW aggregates features dynamically in each node, which allows the network to have more representation power. To facilitate effective training, we further represent the network connectivity of each sample as an adjacency matrix. The matrix is updated to aggregate features in the forward pass, cached in the memory, and used for gradient computing in the backward pass.

Contrast and Classify: Training Robust VQA Models,"Yash Kant, Abhinav Moudgil, Dhruv Batra, Devi Parikh, Harsh Agrawal"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 1604-1613","Recent Visual Question Answering (VQA) models have shown impressive performance on the VQA benchmark but remain sensitive to small linguistic variations in input questions. Existing approaches address this by augmenting the dataset with question paraphrases from visual question generation models or adversarial perturbations. These approaches use the combined data to learn an answer classifier by minimizing the standard cross-entropy loss. To more effectively leverage augmented data, we build on the recent success in contrastive learning. We propose a novel training paradigm (ConClaT) that optimizes both cross-entropy and contrastive losses. The contrastive loss encourages representations to be robust to linguistic variations in questions while the cross-entropy loss preserves the discriminative power of representations for answer prediction. We find that optimizing both losses -- either alternately or jointly -- is key to effective training. On the VQA-Rephrasings benchmark, which measures the VQA model's answer consistency across human paraphrases of a question, ConClaT improves Consensus Score by 1.63% over an improved baseline. In addition, on the standard VQA 2.0 benchmark, we improve the VQA accuracy by 0.78% overall.

Photon-Starved Scene Inference Using Single Photon Cameras,"Bhavya Goyal, Mohit Gupta"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 2512-2521","Scene understanding under low-light conditions is a challenging problem. This is due to the small number of photons captured by the camera and the resulting low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Single-photon cameras (SPCs) are an emerging sensing modality that are capable of capturing images with high sensitivity. Despite having minimal read-noise, images captured by SPCs in photon-starved conditions still suffer from strong shot noise, preventing reliable scene inference. We propose photon scale-space -- a collection of high-SNR images spanning a wide range of photons-per-pixel (PPP) levels (but same scene content) as guides to train inference model on low photon flux images. We develop training techniques that push images with different illumination levels closer to each other in feature representation space. The key idea is that having a spectrum of different brightness levels during training enables effective guidance, and increases robustness to shot noise even in extreme noise cases. Based on the proposed approach, we demonstrate, via simulations and real experiments with a SPAD camera, high-performance on various inference tasks such as image classification and monocular depth estimation under ultra low-light, down to <1 PPP.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Goyal_Photon-Starved_Scene_Inference_Using_Single_Photon_Cameras_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

Spatial-temporal representations can provide richer and complementary information between frames, which are crucial to distinguish the target person when occlusion occurs. This paper proposes a novel Pyramid Spatial-Temporal Aggregation (PSTA) framework to aggregate the frame-level features progressively and fuse the hierarchical temporal features into a final video-level representation. Thus, short-term and long-term temporal information could be well exploited by different hierarchies. Furthermore, a Spatial-Temporal Aggregation Module (STAM) is proposed to enhance the aggregation capability of PSTA. It mainly consists of two novel attention blocks: Spatial Reference Attention (SRA) and Temporal Reference Attention (TRA). SRA explores the spatial correlations within a frame to determine the attention weight of each location. While TRA extends SRA with the correlations between adjacent frames, temporal consistency information can be fully explored to suppress the interference features and strengthen the discriminative ones.

By providing massive training samples, it helps to improve the generalization ability of the model. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) is a challenging problem that has been deeply studied in recent years, conventional data augmentation approaches for WSSS usually employ geometrical transformations, random cropping, and color jittering. However, merely increasing the same contextual semantic data does not bring much gain to the networks to distinguish the objects, e.g., the correct image-level classification of ""aeroplane"" may be not only due to the recognition of the object itself but also its co-occurrence context like ""sky"", which will cause the model to focus less on the object features. To this end, we present a Context Decoupling Augmentation (CDA) method, to change the inherent context in which the objects appear and thus drive the network to remove the dependence between object instances and contextual information.

For the first time, we propose a unified framework that can handle 9DoF object pose tracking for novel rigid object instances as well as per-part pose tracking for articulated objects from known categories. Here the 9DoF pose, comprising 6D pose and 3D size, is equivalent to a 3D amodal bounding box representation with free 6D pose. Given the depth point cloud at the current frame and the estimated pose from the last frame, our novel end-to-end pipeline learns to accurately update the pose. Our pipeline is composed of three modules: 1) a pose canonicalization module that normalizes the pose of the input depth point cloud; 2) RotationNet, a module that directly regresses small interframe delta rotations; and 3) CoordinateNet, a module that predicts the normalized coordinates and segmentation, enabling analytical computation of the 3D size and translation. Leveraging the small pose regime in the pose-canonicalized point clouds, our method integrates the best of both worlds by combining dense coordinate prediction and direct rotation regression, thus yielding an end-to-end differentiable pipeline optimized for 9DoF pose accuracy (without using non-differentiable RANSAC).

Zhang, Javen Qinfeng Shi, Anton van den Hengel"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 11843-11852","Dynamic interacting systems are prevalent in vision tasks. These interactions are usually difficult to observe and measure directly, and yet understanding latent interactions is essential for performing inference tasks on dynamic systems like forecasting. Neural relational inference (NRI) techniques are thus introduced to explicitly estimate interpretable relations between the entities in the system for trajectory prediction. However, NRI assumes static relations; thus, dynamic neural relational inference (DNRI) was proposed to handle dynamic relations using LSTM. Unfortunately, the older information will be washed away when the LSTM updates the latent variable as a whole, which is why DNRI struggles with modeling long-term dependences and forecasting long sequences. This motivates us to propose a memory-augmented dynamic neural relational inference method, which maintains two associative memory pools: one for the interactive relations and the other for the individual entities. The two memory pools help retain useful relation features and node features for the estimation in the future steps. Our model dynamically estimates the relations by learning better embeddings and utilizing the long-range information stored in the memory. With the novel memory modules and customized structures, our memory-augmented DNRI can update and access the memory adaptively as required. The memory pools also serve as global latent variables across time to maintain detailed long-term temporal relations readily available for other components to use.

Identifying that the main source of error is action incompleteness (i.e., missing parts of actions), we alleviate it by designing an unsupervised foreground attention (UFA) module utilizing the conditional independence between foreground and background motion. Then we incorporate weakly-labeled data into SSAD and propose Omni-supervised Action Detection (OSAD) with three levels of supervision. To overcome the accompanying action-context confusion problem in OSAD baselines, an information bottleneck (IB) is designed to suppress the scene information in non-action frames while preserving the action information. We extensively benchmark against the baselines for SSAD and OSAD on our created data splits in THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed UFA and IB methods.

In contrast to many current approaches to video denoising, UDVD does not require explicit motion compensation. This is advantageous because motion compensation is computationally expensive, and can be unreliable when the input data are noisy.

One of the popular solutions is to exploit the temporal information and enhance per-frame representation through aggregating features from neighboring frames. Despite achieving improvements in detection, existing methods focus on the selection of higher-level video frames for aggregation rather than modeling lower-level temporal relations to increase the feature representation. To address this limitation, we propose a novel solution named TF-Blender, which includes three modules: 1) Temporal relation models the relations between the current frame and its neighboring frames to preserve spatial information. 2).

Conventional adversarial training methods are not suitable for the adversarial robustness on the unlabeled target domain of UDA since they train models with adversarial examples generated by the supervised loss function. In this work, we propose to leverage intermediate representations learned by robust ImageNet models to improve the robustness of UDA models.

In this work, we tackle the problem of 3D part discovery from only 2D image collections. Instead of relying on manually annotated parts for supervision, we propose a self-supervised approach, latent part discovery (LPD).

The main idea of instance contrastive learning is to match a same instance in different augmented views. However, the relationship between different instances has not been fully explored in previous contrastive methods, especially for instance-level contrastive loss. To address this issue, we propose Inter-instance Contrastive Encoding (ICE) that leverages inter-instance pairwise similarity scores to boost previous class-level contrastive ReID methods. We first use pairwise similarity ranking as one-hot hard pseudo labels for hard instance contrast, which aims at reducing intra-class variance. Then, we use similarity scores as soft pseudo labels to enhance the consistency between augmented and original views, which makes our model more robust to augmentation perturbations.

ShapeConv: Shape-Aware Convolutional Layer for Indoor RGB-D Semantic Segmentation,"Jinming Cao, Hanchao Leng, Dani Lischinski, Daniel Cohen-Or, Changhe Tu, Yangyan Li"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 7088-7097","RGB-D semantic segmentation has attracted increasing attention over the past few years. Existing methods mostly employ homogeneous convolution operators to consume the RGB and depth features, ignoring their intrinsic differences. In fact, the RGB values capture the photometric appearance properties in the projected image space, while the depth feature encodes both the shape of a local geometry as well as the base (whereabout) of it in a larger context. Compared with the base, the shape probably is more inherent and has a stronger connection to the semantics, and thus is more critical for segmentation accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we introduce Shape-aware Convolutional layer (ShapeConv) for processing the depth feature, where the depth feature is firstly decomposed into a shape-component and a base-component, next two learnable weights are introduced to cooperate with them independently, and finally a convolution is applied on the re-weighted combination of these two components. ShapeConv is model-agnostic and can be easily integrated into most CNNs to replace vanilla convolutional layers for semantic segmentation. Extensive experiments on three challenging indoor RGB-D semantic segmentation benchmarks, i.e., NYU-Dv2(-13,-40), SUN RGB-D, and SID, demonstrate the effectiveness of our ShapeConv when employing it over five popular architectures. Moreover, the performance of CNNs with ShapeConv is boosted without introducing any computation and memory increase in the inference phase. The reason is that the learnt weights for balancing the importance between the shape and base components in ShapeConv become constants in the inference phase, and thus can be fused into the following convolution, resulting in a network that is identical to one with vanilla convolutional layers.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Cao_ShapeConv_Shape-Aware_Convolutional_Layer_for_Indoor_RGB-D_Semantic_Segmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

To address this, we introduce SNARF, which combines the advantages of linear blend skinning (LBS) for polygonal meshes with those of neural implicit surfaces by learning a forward deformation field without direct supervision. This deformation field is defined in canonical, pose-independent, space, enabling generalization to unseen poses. Learning the deformation field from posed meshes alone is challenging since the correspondences of deformed points are defined implicitly and may not be unique under changes of topology.

We note that adopting such cross-modal contrastive learning between 2D images and 3D shapes into IBSR tasks is non-trivial and challenging: contrastive learning requires very strong data augmentation in constructed positive pairs to learn the feature invariance, whereas traditional metric learning works do not have this requirement. Moreover, object shape and appearance are entangled in 2D query images, thus making the learning task more difficult than contrasting single-modal data. To mitigate the challenges, we propose to use multi-view grayscale rendered images from the 3D shapes as a shape representation. We then introduce a strong data augmentation technique based on color transfer, which can significantly but naturally change the appearance of the query image, effectively satisfying the need for contrastive learning.

We argue that this stems from the way data is collected. Designing and collecting static datasets of images (or videos) locks us in to specific design choices and limits us to post-hoc analyses. In practice, vision datasets only include specific domains and tasks. This not only makes it necessary and difficult to combine datsets, but leads to scattershot overall coverage that frustrates systemic research into the interaction of tasks, data, models, and learning algorithms. For example, if a model trained for ImageNet classification on ImageNet transfers better to CoCo than does a model trained for Kitti depth estimation--is that due to the difference in tasks or the different training data? We note that one way to do this is to use a comprehensive, standardized scene representation that contains extra information about the scene, and then to use that to create a specific dataset of study. We introduce a platform for doing this. Specifically, we provide a pipeline that takes as input a 3D scans and generates multi-task datasets of mid-level cues. The pipeline exposes complete control over the generation process, is implemented in mostly python, and we provide ecosystem tools such as a Docker and PyTorch dataloaders. We also provide a starter dataset of several recent 3D scan datasets, processed into standard static datasets of mid-level cues. We show that this starter dataset (generated from the annotator pipeline) is reliable; it yields models that provide state-of-the-art performance for several tasks. It yields human-level surface normal estimation performance on OASIS, despite having never seen OASIS data during training. With the proliferation of cheaper 3D sensors (e.g. on the newest iPhone), we anticipate that releasing an automated tool for this processing pipeline will allow the starter set to continue to expand and cover more domains.

However, most FSS methods rely on unidirectional feature aggregation, e.g., from support prototypes to get the query prediction, and from high-resolution features to guide the low-resolution ones. This usually fails to fully capture the cross-resolution feature relationships and thus leads to inaccurate estimates of the query objects. To resolve the above dilemma, we propose a cyclic memory network (CMN) to directly learn to read abundant support information from all resolution features in a cyclic manner. Specifically, we first generate N pairs (key and value) of multi-resolution query features guided by the support feature and its mask. Next, we circularly take one pair of these features as the query to be segmented, and the rest N-1 pairs are written into an external memory accordingly, i.e., this leave-one-out process is conducted for N times. In each cycle, the query feature is updated by collaboratively matching its key and value with the memory, which can elegantly cover all the spatial locations from different resolutions. Furthermore, we incorporate the query feature re-adding and the query feature recursive updating mechanisms into the memory reading operation. CMN, equipped with these merits, can thus capture cross-resolution relationships and better handle the object appearance and scale variations in FSS. Experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i well validate the effectiveness of our model for FSS.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Xie_Few-Shot_Semantic_Segmentation_With_Cyclic_Memory_Network_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Weakly-Supervised Action Segmentation and Alignment via Transcript-Aware Union-of-Subspaces Learning,"Zijia Lu, Ehsan Elhamifar"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 8085-8095","We address the problem of learning to segment actions from weakly-annotated videos, i.e., videos accompanied by transcripts (ordered list of actions). We propose a framework in which we model actions with a union of low-dimensional subspaces, learn the subspaces using transcripts and refine video features that lend themselves to action subspaces. To do so, we design an architecture consisting of a Union-of-Subspace Network, which is an ensemble of autoencoders, each modeling a low-dimensional action subspace and can capture variations of an action within and across videos. For learning, at each iteration, we generate positive and negative soft alignment matrices using the segmentations from the previous iteration, which we use for discriminative training of our model. To regularize the learning, we introduce a constraint loss that prevents imbalanced segmentations and enforces relatively similar duration of each action across videos. To have a real-time inference, we develop a hierarchical segmentation framework that uses subset selection to find representative transcripts and hierarchically align a test video with increasingly refined representative transcripts.

To address the above issue, we propose a Hierarchical Operation-adaptive Predictor (HOP) for NAS.

In this work, we present a novel, flexible, and effective transformer-based model for high-quality instance segmentation. The proposed method, Segmenting Objects with TRansformers (SOTR), simplifies the segmentation pipeline, building on an alternative CNN backbone appended with two parallel subtasks: (1) predicting per-instance category via transformer and (2) dynamically generating segmentation mask with the multi-level upsampling module. SOTR can effectively extract lower-level feature representations and capture long-range context dependencies by Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) and twin transformer, respectively. Meanwhile, compared with the original transformer, the proposed twin transformer is timeand resource-efficient since only a row and a column attention are involved to encode pixels. Moreover, SOTR is easy to be incorporated with various CNN backbones and transformer model variants to make considerable improvements for the segmentation accuracy and training convergence. Extensive experiments show that our SOTR performs well on the MS COCO dataset and surpasses state-of-the-art instance segmentation approaches.

Coming to the era of high resolution, SOD methods are facing new challenges. The major limitation of previous methods is that they try to identify the salient regions and estimate the accurate objects boundaries simultaneously with a single regression task at low-resolution. This practice ignores the inherent difference between the two difficult problems, resulting in poor detection quality. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning framework for high-resolution SOD task, which disentangles the task into a low-resolution saliency classification network (LRSCN) and a high-resolution refinement network (HRRN).

HRRN is a regression task, which aims at accurately refining the saliency value of pixels in the uncertain region to preserve a clear object boundary at high-resolution with limited GPU memory. It is worth noting that by introducing uncertainty into the training process, our HRRN can well address the high-resolution refinement task without using any high-resolution training data.

Then, with the estimated blur kernels, we develop an effective image deconvolution method based on the image formation model of blind video SR to generate intermediate latent frames so that sharp image contents can be restored well. To effectively explore the information from adjacent frames, we estimate the motion fields from LR input videos, extract features from LR videos by a feature extraction network, and warp the extracted features from LR inputs based on the motion fields. Moreover, we develop an effective sharp feature exploration method which first extracts sharp features from restored intermediate latent frames and then uses a transformation operation based on the extracted sharp features and warped features from LR inputs to generate better features for HR video restoration.

To address this problem, we propose to adaptively learn an ensemble of features that characterizes an image from different aspects to model both interclass and intraclass distributions.

Sample Efficient Detection and Classification of Adversarial Attacks via Self-Supervised Embeddings,"Mazda Moayeri, Soheil Feizi"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 7677-7686","Adversarial robustness of deep models is pivotal in ensuring safe deployment in real world settings, but most modern defenses have narrow scope and expensive costs. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised method to detect adversarial attacks and classify them to their respective threat models, based on a linear model operating on the embeddings from a pre-trained self-supervised encoder. We use a SimCLR encoder in our experiments, since we show the SimCLR embedding distance is a good proxy for human perceptibility, enabling it to encapsulate many threat models at once. We call our method SimCat since it uses SimCLR encoder to catch and categorize various types of adversarial attacks, including L_p and non-L_p evasion attacks, as well as data poisonings. The simple nature of a linear classifier makes our method efficient in both time and sample complexity. For example, on SVHN, using only five pairs of clean and adversarial examples computed with a PGD-L_inf attack, SimCat's detection accuracy is over 85%. Moreover, on ImageNet, using only 25 examples from each threat model, SimCat can classify eight different attack types such as PGD-L_2, PGD-L_inf, CW-L_2, PPGD, LPA, StAdv, ReColor, and JPEG-L_inf, with over 40% accuracy. On STL10 data, we apply SimCat as a defense against poisoning attacks, such as BP, CP, FC, CLBD, HTBD, halving the success rate while using only twenty total poisons for training. We find that the detectors generalize well to unseen threat models.

Attackers intend to inject hidden backdoors into DNNs, such that the attacked model performs well on benign samples, whereas its prediction will be maliciously changed if hidden backdoors are activated by the attacker-defined trigger. Existing backdoor attacks usually adopt the setting that triggers are sample-agnostic, i.e., different poisoned samples contain the same trigger, resulting in that the attacks could be easily mitigated by current backdoor defenses. In this work, we explore a novel attack paradigm, where backdoor triggers are sample-specific. In our attack, we only need to modify certain training samples with invisible perturbation, while not need to manipulate other training components (e.g., training loss, and model structure) as required in many existing attacks. Specifically, inspired by the recent advance in DNN-based image steganography, we generate sample-specific invisible additive noises as backdoor triggers by encoding an attacker-specified string into benign images through an encoder-decoder network. The mapping from the string to the target label will be generated when DNNs are trained on the poisoned dataset.

We propose a parameter-efficient multi-mode modulator to address both challenges. First, the modulator is designed to maintain multiple modulation parameters (one for each domain) in a single network, thus achieving single-network multi-domain representation. Given a particular domain, domain-aware features can be efficiently generated with the well-devised separative selection module and cooperative query module. Second, we further divide the modulation parameters into the domain-specific set and the domain-cooperative set to explore the intra-domain information and inter-domain correlations, respectively. The intra-domain information describes each domain independently to prevent negative interference. The inter-domain correlations guide information sharing among relevant domains to enrich their own representation. Moreover, unseen domains can utilize the correlations to obtain an adaptive combination of seen domains for extrapolation.

The key intuition is that such representation should be abstract at design, so to accommodate the abstract nature of sketches. This is achieved by interpreting sketch abstraction on two levels: appearance and structure. We abstract sketch structure as a pre-defined coarse-to-fine visual block hierarchy, and average visual features within each block to model appearance abstraction.

The superiority of explicitly abstracting sketch representation is empirically validated on a number of sketch analysis tasks, including sketch recognition, fine-grained sketch-based image retrieval, and generative sketch healing.

Therefore, in contrast to recent works using a fixed curriculum, we devise a new curriculum learning method, Adaptive Curriculum Learning (Adaptive CL), adapting the difficulty of examples to the current state of the model. Specifically, we make use of the loss of the current model to adjust the difficulty score while retaining previous useful learned knowledge by KL divergence. Moreover, under a non-linear model and binary classification, we theoretically prove that the expected convergence rate of curriculum learning monotonically decreases with respect to the loss of a point regarding the optimal hypothesis, and monotonically increases with respect to the loss of a point regarding the current hypothesis.

Equipped by such annotations, we introduce the task of panoptic symbol spotting, which requires to spot not only instances of countable things, but also the semantic of uncountable stuff. Aiming to solve this task, we propose a novel method by combining Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which captures both non-Euclidean and Euclidean features and can be trained end-to-end. The proposed CNN-GCN method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the task of semantic symbol spotting, and help us build a baseline network for the panoptic symbol spotting task. Our contributions are three-fold: 1) to the best of our knowledge, the presented CAD drawing dataset is the first of its kind; 2) the panoptic symbol spotting task considers the spotting of both thing instances and stuff semantic as one recognition problem; and 3) we presented a baseline solution to the panoptic symbol spotting task based on a novel CNN-GCN method, which achieved SOTA performance on semantic symbol spotting. We believe that these contributions will boost research in related areas.

Recent studies improve the conventional adversarial domain adaptation methods with discriminative information by integrating the classifier's outputs into distribution divergence measurement. However, they still suffer from the equilibrium problem of adversarial learning in which even if the discriminator is fully confused, sufficient similarity between two distributions cannot be guaranteed. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel approach named feature gradient distribution alignment (FGDA). We demonstrate the rationale of our method both theoretically and empirically. In particular, we show that the distribution discrepancy can be reduced by constraining feature gradients of two domains to have similar distributions.

Sparse-Shot Learning With Exclusive Cross-Entropy for Extremely Many Localisations,"Andreas Panteli, Jonas Teuwen, Hugo Horlings, Efstratios Gavves"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 2813-2823","Object localisation, in the context of regular images, often depicts objects like people or cars. In these images, there is typically a relatively small number of objects per class, which usually is manageable to annotate. However, outside the setting of regular images, we are often confronted with a different situation. In computational pathology, digitised tissue sections are extremely large images, whose dimensions quickly exceed 250'000x250'000 pixels, where relevant objects, such as tumour cells or lymphocytes can quickly number in the millions. Annotating them all is practically impossible and annotating sparsely a few, out of many more, is the only possibility. Unfortunately, learning from sparse annotations, or sparse-shot learning, clashes with standard supervised learning because what is not annotated is treated as a negative. However, assigning negative labels to what are true positives leads to confusion in the gradients and biased learning. To this end, we present exclusive cross-entropy, which slows down the biased learning by examining the second-order loss derivatives in order to drop the loss terms corresponding to likely biased terms. Experiments on nine datasets and two different localisation tasks, detection with YOLLO and segmentation with Unet, show that we obtain considerable improvements compared to cross-entropy or focal loss, while often reaching the best possible performance for the model with only 10-40% of annotations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Panteli_Sparse-Shot_Learning_With_Exclusive_Cross-Entropy_for_Extremely_Many_Localisations_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with Shifted windows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size.

Thus our DCFNet can represent the overall information well. In order to enhance the relationships of inter-branches, dynamic cross feature transfers are embedded into multiple branches to obtain high-resolution representations. Then contextualized features will be learned to improve the fusion of information. Experimental results indicate that DCFNet significantly outperforms the prior arts in both quantitative indicators and visual qualities.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wu_Dynamic_Cross_Feature_Fusion_for_Remote_Sensing_Pansharpening_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

In this paper, we address all three challenges. Firstly, we propose a language scene graph module to capture the rich structure and long-distance phrase correlations. Secondly, we introduce a multi-level 3D proposal relation graph module to extract the object-object and object-scene co-occurrence relationships, and strengthen the visual features of the initial proposals.

Unlike the conventional digital cameras that compact the visual information within the exposure interval into a single snapshot, the spike camera continuously outputs binary spike streams to record the dynamic scenes, yielding a very high temporal resolution. Most of the existing reconstruction methods for spike camera focus on reconstructing images with the same resolution as spike camera. However, as a trade-off of high temporal resolution, the spatial resolution of spike camera is limited, resulting in inferior details of the reconstruction. To address this issue, we develop a spike camera super-resolution framework, aiming to super resolve high-resolution intensity images from the low-resolution binary spike streams. Due to the relative motion between the camera and the objects to capture, the spikes fired by the same sensor pixel no longer describes the same points in the external scene.

Therefore, we propose our work, DRINet, which serves as the basic network structure for dual-representation learning with great flexibility at feature transferring and less computation cost, especially for large-scale point clouds. DRINet mainly consists of two modules called Sparse Point-Voxel Feature Extraction and Sparse Voxel-Point Feature Extraction.

We show that the small size of CNN kernels make them susceptible to spectral leakage, which may induce performance-degrading artifacts. To address this issue, we propose the use of larger kernel sizes along with the Hamming window function to alleviate leakage in CNN architectures. We demonstrate improved classification accuracy on multiple benchmark datasets including Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet with the simple use of a standard window function in convolutional layers.

However, due to some inherent properties (eg, local inductive prior, spatial-invariant kernels), CNNs do not perform well in understanding global structures or naturally support pluralistic completion. Recently, transformers demonstrate their power in modeling the long-term relationship and generating diverse results, but their computation complexity is quadratic to input length, thus hampering the application in processing high-resolution images. This paper brings the best of both worlds to pluralistic image completion: appearance prior reconstruction with transformer and texture replenishment with CNN. The former transformer recovers pluralistic coherent structures together with some coarse textures, while the latter CNN enhances the local texture details of coarse priors guided by the high-resolution masked images. The proposed method vastly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of three aspects: 1) large performance boost on image fidelity even compared to deterministic completion methods; 2) better diversity and higher fidelity for pluralistic completion; 3) exceptional generalization ability on large masks and generic dataset, like ImageNet.

Such a framework can learn not only the spatio-temporal interactions among the actors which are important for detecting complex movements, but also their short- and long-term dependencies across frames. Also, to deal with both local and non-local relationships of the features, a new variant of self-attention is developed by taking into consideration a set of cliques with different temporal localities.

The challenging nature of the very problem however dictated a fragmentation of research efforts: Scene Text Recognition (STR) that deals with text in everyday scenes, and Handwriting Text Recognition (HTR) that tackles hand-written text. In this paper, for the first time, we argue for their unification -- we aim for a single model that can compete favourably with two separate state-of-the-art STR and HTR models. We first show that cross-utilisation of STR and HTR models trigger significant performance drops due to differences in their inherent challenges. We then tackle their union by introducing a knowledge distillation (KD) based framework. This however is non-trivial, largely due to the variable-length and sequential nature of text sequences, which renders off-the-shelf KD techniques that mostly work with global fixed length data, inadequate. For that, we propose four distillation losses, all of which are specifically designed to cope with the aforementioned unique characteristics of text recognition. Empirical evidence suggests that our proposed unified model performs at par with individual models, even surpassing them in certain cases.

We propose a Hierarchical Dance Video Recognition framework (HDVR). HDVR estimates 2D pose sequences, tracks dancers, and then simultaneously estimates corresponding 3D poses and 3D-to-2D imaging parameters, without requiring ground truth for 3D poses. Unlike most methods that work on a single person, our tracking works on multiple dancers, under occlusions. From the estimated 3D pose sequence, HDVR extracts body part movements, and therefrom dance genre. The resulting hierarchical dance representation is explainable to experts. To overcome noise and interframe correspondence ambiguities, we enforce spatial and temporal motion smoothness and photometric continuity over time. We use an LSTM network to extract 3D movement subsequences from which we recognize dance genre. For experiments, we have identified 154 movement types, of 16 body parts, and assembled a new University of Illinois Dance (UID) Dataset, containing 1143 video clips of 9 genres covering 30 hours, annotated with movement and genre labels.

In this paper, we formulate the expansion of object regions in CAM as an increase in information. From the perspective of information theory, we propose a novel Complementary Patch (CP) Representation and prove that the information of the sum of the CAMs by a pair of input images with complementary hidden (patched) parts, namely CP Pair, is greater than or equal to the information of the baseline CAM. Therefore, a CAM with more information related to object seeds can be obtained by narrowing down the gap between the sum of CAMs generated by the CP Pair and the original CAM. We propose a CP Network (CPN) implemented by a triplet network and three regularization functions. To further improve the quality of the CAMs, we propose a Pixel-Region Correlation Module (PRCM) to augment the contextual information by using object-region relations between the feature maps and the CAMs. Experimental results on the PASCAL VOC 2012 datasets show that our proposed method achieves a new state-of-the-art in WSSS, validating the effectiveness of our CP Representation and CPN.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Zhang_Complementary_Patch_for_Weakly_Supervised_Semantic_Segmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

With the motion model we generate pseudo-labels for a large unlabeled video collection, which enables us to transfer knowledge by learning to predict these pseudo-labels with an appearance model. Moreover, we introduce a multi-clip loss as a simple yet efficient way to improve the quality of the pseudo-labeling, even without additional auxiliary tasks. We also take into consideration the temporal granularity of videos during self-training of the appearance model, which was missed in previous works. As a result we obtain a strong motion-augmented representation model suited for video downstream tasks like action recognition and clip retrieval. On small-scale video datasets, MotionFit outperforms alternatives for knowledge transfer by 5%-8%, video-only self-supervision by 1%-7% and semisupervised learning by 9%-18% using the same amount of class labels.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Gavrilyuk_Motion-Augmented_Self-Training_for_Video_Recognition_at_Smaller_Scale_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Generating Smooth Pose Sequences for Diverse Human Motion Prediction,"Wei Mao, Miaomiao Liu, Mathieu Salzmann"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 13309-13318","Recent progress in stochastic motion prediction, i.e., predicting multiple possible future human motions given a single past pose sequence, has led to producing truly diverse future motions and even providing control over the motion of some body parts. However, to achieve this, the state-of-the-art method requires learning several mappings for diversity and a dedicated model for controllable motion prediction. In this paper, we introduce a unified deep generative network for both diverse and controllable motion prediction. To this end, we leverage the intuition that realistic human motions consist of smooth sequences of valid poses, and that, given limited data, learning a pose prior is much more tractable than a motion one. We therefore design a generator that predicts the motion of different body parts sequentially, and introduce a normalizing flow based pose prior, together with a joint angle loss, to achieve motion realism.Our experiments on two standard benchmark datasets, Human3.6M and HumanEva-I, demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both sample diversity and accuracy.

Our key contribution is DensePose 3D, a novel parametric model of an articulated mesh, which can be learned in a self-supervised fashion from 2D image annotations only. This is in stark contrast with previous human body reconstruction methods that utilize a parametric model like SMPL pre-trained on a large dataset of 3D body scans that had to be obtained in a controlled environment. DensePose 3D can thus be applied for modelling broad range of articulated categories such as animal species. In an end-to-end fashion, it automatically learns to softly assign each vertex of a category-specific 3D template mesh to one of the rigidly moving latent parts and trains a single-view network predicting rigid motions of the parts to deform the template so that it re-projects correctly to the dense 2D surface annotations of objects (such as DensePose). In order to prevent unrealistic template deformations, we further propose to align the motions of nearby mesh vertices by expressing the part assignment as a function of the smooth eigenfunctions of the Laplace--Beltrami operator computed on the template mesh.

To free image prior learning from the image collection burden, a novel Self-Supervised learning method for Gaussian Mixture Model (SS-GMM) is proposed in this paper. It can simultaneously achieve the noise level estimation and the image prior learning directly from only a single noisy image. This work is derived from our study on eigenvalues of the GMM's covariance matrix. Through statistical experiments and theoretical analysis, we conclude that (1) covariance eigenvalues for clean images hold the sparsity; and that (2) those for noisy images contain sufficient information for noise estimation. The first conclusion inspires us to impose a sparsity constraint on covariance eigenvalues during the learning process to suppress the influence of noise. The second conclusion leads to a self-contained noise estimation module of high accuracy in our proposed method. This module serves to estimate the noise level and automatically determine the specific level of the sparsity constraint. Our final derived method requires only minor modifications to the standard expectation-maximization algorithm. This makes it easy to implement. Very interestingly, the GMM learned via our proposed self-supervised learning method can even achieve better image denoising performance than its supervised counterpart, i.e., the EPLL. Also, it is on par with the state-of-the-art self-supervised deep learning method, i.e., the Self2Self.

Exploiting a Joint Embedding Space for Generalized Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Donghyeon Baek, Youngmin Oh, Bumsub Ham"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 9536-9545","We address the problem of generalized zero-shot semantic segmentation (GZS3) predicting pixel-wise semantic labels for seen and unseen classes. Most GZS3 methods adopt a generative approach that synthesizes visual features of unseen classes from corresponding semantic ones (e.g., word2vec) to train novel classifiers for both seen and unseen classes. Although generative methods show decent performance, they have two limitations: (1) the visual features are biased towards seen classes; (2) the classifier should be retrained whenever novel unseen classes appear. We propose a discriminative approach to address these limitations in a unified framework. To this end, we leverage visual and semantic encoders to learn a joint embedding space, where the semantic encoder transforms semantic features to semantic prototypes that act as centers for visual features of corresponding classes. Specifically, we introduce boundary-aware regression (BAR) and semantic consistency (SC) losses to learn discriminative features. Our approach to exploiting the joint embedding space, together with BAR and SC terms, alleviates the seen bias problem. At test time, we avoid the retraining process by exploiting semantic prototypes as a nearest-neighbor (NN) classifier. To further alleviate the bias problem, we also propose an inference technique, dubbed Apollonius calibration (AC), that modulates the decision boundary of the NN classifier to the Apollonius circle adaptively.

However, ensuring both discriminability and diversity in the augmented samples is challenging. To address this, we propose a feature disentanglement framework that allows us to augment features with randomly sampled intra-class variations while preserving their class-discriminative features. Specifically, we disentangle a feature representation into two components: one represents the intra-class variance and the other encodes the class-discriminative information. We assume that the intra-class variance induced by variations in poses, backgrounds, or illumination conditions is shared across all classes and can be modelled via a common distribution. Then we sample features repeatedly from the learned intra-class variability distribution and add them to the class-discriminative features to get the augmented features. Such a data augmentation scheme ensures that the augmented features inherit crucial class-discriminative features while exhibiting large intra-class variance.

Self-supervised learning (SSL), which leverages unlabeled data only for representation learning, might be a promising way to improve model performance. Existing SSL methods, however, usually rely on the single-centric-object guarantee, which may not be applicable for multi-instance datasets such as street scenes. To alleviate this limitation, we raise two issues to solve: (1) how to define positive samples for cross-view consistency and (2) how to measure similarity in multi-instance circumstances. We first adopt an IoU threshold during random cropping to transfer global-inconsistency to local-consistency. Then, we propose two feature alignment methods to enable 2D feature maps for multi-instance similarity measurement.

However, most such approaches focus on representing closed shapes. Unsigned distance function (UDF) based approaches have been proposed recently as a promising alternative to represent both open and closed shapes. However, since the gradients of UDFs vanish on the surface, it is challenging to estimate local (differential) geometric properties like the normals and tangent planes which are needed for many downstream applications in vision and graphics. There are additional challenges in computing these properties efficiently with a low-memory footprint. This paper presents a novel approach that models such surfaces using a new class of implicit representations called the closest surface-point CSP representation. We show that CSP allows us to represent complex surfaces of any topology (open or closed) with high fidelity. It also allows for accurate and efficient computation of local geometric properties. We further demonstrate that it leads to efficient implementation of downstream algorithms like sphere-tracing for rendering the 3D surface as well as to create explicit mesh-based representations.

Distinctiveness Oriented Positional Equilibrium for Point Cloud Registration,"Taewon Min, Chonghyuk Song, Eunseok Kim, Inwook Shim"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 5490-5498","Recent state-of-the-art learning-based approaches to point cloud registration have largely been based on graph neural networks (GNN). However, these prominent GNN backbones suffer from the indistinguishable features problem associated with over-smoothing and structural ambiguity of the high-level features, a crucial bottleneck to point cloud registration that has evaded scrutiny in the recent relevant literature. To address this issue, we propose the Distinctiveness oriented Positional Equilibrium (DoPE) module, a novel positional embedding scheme that significantly improves the distinctiveness of the high-level features within both the source and target point clouds, resulting in superior point matching and hence registration accuracy. Specifically, we use the DoPE module in an iterative registration framework, whereby the two point clouds are gradually registered via rigid transformations that are computed from DoPE's position-aware features. With every successive iteration, the DoPE module feeds increasingly consistent positional information to would-be corresponding pairs, which in turn enhances the resulting point-to-point correspondence predictions used to estimate the rigid transformation. Within only a few iterations, the network converges to a desired equilibrium, where the positional embeddings given to matching pairs become essentially identical. We validate the effectiveness of DoPE through comprehensive experiments on various registration benchmarks, registration task settings, and prominent backbones, yielding unprecedented performance improvement across all combinations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Min_Distinctiveness_Oriented_Positional_Equilibrium_for_Point_Cloud_Registration_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

We propose a light weight deep learning model for reflection removal using a novel scale space architecture. Our method processes the corrupted image in two stages, a Low Scale Sub-network (LSSNet) to process the lowest scale and a Progressive Inference (PI) stage to process all the higher scales. In order to reduce the computational complexity, the sub-networks in PI stage are designed to be much shallower than LSSNet. Moreover, we employ weight sharing between various scales within the PI stage to limit the model size. This also allows our method to generalize to very high resolutions without explicit retraining.

Many offline tracking approaches reason about occluded objects post-hoc, by linking together tracklets after the object re-appears, making use of reidentification (ReID). However, online tracking in embodied robotic agents (such as a self-driving vehicle) fundamentally requires object permanence, which is the ability to reason about occluded objects before they re-appear. In this work, we re-purpose tracking benchmarks and propose new metrics for the task of detecting invisible objects, focusing on the illustrative case of people. We demonstrate that current detection and tracking systems perform dramatically worse on this task. We introduce two key innovations to recover much of this performance drop. We treat occluded object detection in temporal sequences as a short-term forecasting challenge, bringing to bear tools from dynamic sequence prediction. Second, we build dynamic models that explicitly reason in 3D from monocular videos without calibration, using observations produced by monocular depth estimators.

However, existing works are incapable to deliver a continuous and fine-grained editing mode (e.g., editing a slightly smiling face to a big laughing one) with natural interactions with users. In this work, we propose Talk-to-Edit, an interactive facial editing framework that performs fine-grained attribute manipulation through dialog between the user and the system. Our key insight is to model a continual """"semantic field"""" in the GAN latent space. 1) Unlike previous works that regard the editing as traversing straight lines in the latent space, here the fine-grained editing is formulated as finding a curving trajectory that respects fine-grained attribute landscape on the semantic field. 2) The curvature at each step is location-specific and determined by the input image as well as the users' language requests. 3) To engage the users in a meaningful dialog, our system generates language feedback by considering both the user request and the current state of the semantic field. We also contribute CelebA-Dialog, a visual-language facial editing dataset to facilitate large-scale study. Specifically, each image has manually annotated fine-grained attribute annotations as well as template-based textual descriptions in natural language. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate the superiority of our framework in terms of 1) the smoothness of fine-grained editing, 2) the identity/attribute preservation, and 3) the visual photorealism and dialog fluency.

AgentFormer: Agent-Aware Transformers for Socio-Temporal Multi-Agent Forecasting,"Ye Yuan, Xinshuo Weng, Yanglan Ou, Kris M. Kitani"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 9813-9823","Predicting accurate future trajectories of multiple agents is essential for autonomous systems but is challenging due to the complex interaction between agents and the uncertainty in each agent's future behavior. Forecasting multi-agent trajectories requires modeling two key dimensions: (1) time dimension, where we model the influence of past agent states over future states; (2) social dimension, where we model how the state of each agent affects others. Most prior methods model these two dimensions separately, e.g., first using a temporal model to summarize features over time for each agent independently and then modeling the interaction of the summarized features with a social model. This approach is suboptimal since independent feature encoding over either the time or social dimension can result in a loss of information. Instead, we would prefer a method that allows an agent's state at one time to directly affect another agent's state at a future time. To this end, we propose a new Transformer, termed AgentFormer, that simultaneously models the time and social dimensions. The model leverages a sequence representation of multi-agent trajectories by flattening trajectory features across time and agents. Since standard attention operations disregard the agent identity of each element in the sequence, AgentFormer uses a novel agent-aware attention mechanism that preserves agent identities by attending to elements of the same agent differently than elements of other agents. Based on AgentFormer, we propose a stochastic multi-agent trajectory prediction model that can attend to features of any agent at any previous timestep when inferring an agent's future position. The latent intent of all agents is also jointly modeled, allowing the stochasticity in one agent's behavior to affect other agents.

Specifically, TOTB consists of 225 videos (86K frames) from 15 diverse transparent object categories. Each sequence is manually labeled with axis-aligned bounding boxes.

However, the bounding boxes of most existing WSOD methods are mainly determined by precomputed proposals, thereby being limited in precise object localization. In this paper, we defend the problem setting for improving localization performance by leveraging the bounding box regression knowledge from a well-annotated auxiliary dataset. First, we use the well-annotated auxiliary dataset to explore a series of learnable bounding box adjusters (LBBAs) in a multi-stage training manner, which is class-agnostic. Then, only LBBAs and a weakly-annotated dataset with non-overlapped classes are used for training LBBA-boosted WSOD. As such, our LBBAs are practically more convenient and economical to implement while avoiding the leakage of the auxiliary well-annotated dataset. In particular, we formulate learning bounding box adjusters as a bi-level optimization problem and suggest an EM-like multi-stage training algorithm. Then, a multi-stage scheme is further presented for LBBA-boosted WSOD. Additionally, a masking strategy is adopted to improve proposal classification.

To overcome these limitations, we analyze the potential drawbacks when directly borrowing Transformer architectures from NLP.

Three modifications are made to the original Transformer: 1) instead of the straightforward tokenization from raw input images, we design an Image-to-Tokens (I2T) module that extracts patches from generated low-level features; 2) the feed-froward network in each encoder block is replaced with a Locally-enhanced Feed-Forward (LeFF) layer that promotes the correlation among neighboring tokens in the spatial dimension; 3) a Layer-wise Class token Attention (LCA) is attached at the top of the Transformer that utilizes the multi-level representations. Experimental results on ImageNet and seven downstream tasks show the effectiveness and generalization ability compared with previous Transformers and state-of-the-art CNNs, without requiring a large amount of training data and extra CNN teachers.

In our approach, we reduce the space complexity of the segmentation model's output from O(C) to O(1), propose an approximation method for ground-truth class probability, and use it to compute cross-entropy loss. The proposed approach is general and can be adopted by any state-of-the-art segmentation model to gracefully scale it for any number of semantic classes with only one GPU. Our approach achieves similar, and in some cases even better mIoU for Cityscapes, Pascal VOC and ADE20k dataset when adopted to DeeplabV3+ model with different backbones. We demonstrate a clear benefit of our approach on a dataset with 1284 classes, bootstrapped from LVIS and COCO annotations, with almost three times better mIoU when compared to DeeplabV3+.

This is often an ill-posed problem, since multiple plausible 3D bodies may match the visual evidence present in the input - particularly when the subject is occluded. Thus, it is desirable to estimate a distribution over 3D body shape and pose conditioned on the input image instead of a single 3D reconstruction. We train a deep neural network to estimate a hierarchical matrix-Fisher distribution over relative 3D joint rotation matrices (i.e. body pose), which exploits the human body's kinematic tree structure, as well as a Gaussian distribution over SMPL body shape parameters. To further ensure that the predicted shape and pose distributions match the visual evidence in the input image, we implement a differentiable rejection sampler to impose a reprojection loss between ground-truth 2D joint coordinates and samples from the predicted distributions, projected onto the image plane. We show that our method is competitive with the state-of-the-art in terms of 3D shape and pose metrics on the SSP-3D and 3DPW datasets, while also yielding a structured probability distribution over 3D body shape and pose, with which we can meaningfully quantify prediction uncertainty and sample multiple plausible 3D reconstructions to explain a given input image.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Sengupta_Hierarchical_Kinematic_Probability_Distributions_for_3D_Human_Shape_and_Pose_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

To address the first limitation, which is due to the quadratic computational complexity of the self-attention module in Transformer encoders, we propose a dynamic encoder to approximate the Transformer encoder's attention mechanism using a convolution-based dynamic encoder with various attention types. Such an encoder can dynamically adjust attentions based on multiple factors such as scale importance, spatial importance, and representation (i.e., feature dimension) importance. To mitigate the second limitation of learning difficulty, we introduce a dynamic decoder by replacing the cross-attention module with a ROI-based dynamic attention in the Transformer decoder. Such a decoder effectively assists Transformers to focus on region of interests from a coarse-to-fine manner and dramatically lowers the learning difficulty, leading to a much faster convergence with fewer training epochs. We conduct a series of experiments to demonstrate our advantages. Our Dynamic DETR significantly reduces the training epochs (by \bf 14x ), yet results in a much better performance (by \bf 3.6 on mAP).

Torr, Liang Lin"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 9505-9515","Self-supervised learning (especially contrastive learning) has attracted great interest due to its huge potential in learning discriminative representations in an unsupervised manner. Despite the acknowledged successes, existing contrastive learning methods suffer from very low learning efficiency, e.g., taking about ten times more training epochs than supervised learning for comparable recognition accuracy. In this paper, we reveal two contradictory phenomena in contrastive learning that we call under-clustering and over-clustering problems, which are major obstacles to learning efficiency. Under-clustering means that the model cannot efficiently learn to discover the dissimilarity between inter-class samples when the negative sample pairs for contrastive learning are insufficient to differentiate all the actual object classes. Over-clustering implies that the model cannot efficiently learn features from excessive negative sample pairs, forcing the model to over-cluster samples of the same actual classes into different clusters. To simultaneously overcome these two problems, we propose a novel self-supervised learning framework using a truncated triplet loss. Precisely, we employ a triplet loss tending to maximize the relative distance between the positive pair and negative pairs to address the under-clustering problem; and we construct the negative pair by selecting a negative sample deputy from all negative samples to avoid the over-clustering problem, guaranteed by the Bernoulli Distribution model. We extensively evaluate our framework in several large-scale benchmarks (e.g., ImageNet, SYSU-30k, and COCO).

A natural source for such attributes is the StyleSpace of StyleGAN, which is known to generate semantically meaningful dimensions in the image.

To reduce the huge annotation burden, we propose a Region-based and Diversity-aware Active Learning (ReDAL), a general framework for many deep learning approaches, aiming to automatically select only informative and diverse sub-scene regions for label acquisition. Observing that only a small portion of annotated regions are sufficient for 3D scene understanding with deep learning, we use softmax entropy, color discontinuity, and structural complexity to measure the information of sub-scene regions. A diversity-aware selection algorithm is also developed to avoid redundant annotations resulting from selecting informative but similar regions in a querying batch.

Conventional approaches are only allowed to ask questions at predefined locations, which are built upon expensive dialogue annotations, and inconvenience the real-word human-robot communication and cooperation. In this paper, we propose a Self-Motivated Communication Agent (SCoA) that learns whether and what to communicate with human adaptively to acquire instructive information for realizing dialogue annotation-free navigation and enhancing the transferability in real-world unseen environment. Specifically, we introduce a whether-to-ask (WeTA) policy, together with uncertainty of which action to choose, to indicate whether the agent should ask a question. Then, a what-to-ask (WaTA) policy is proposed, in which, along with the oracle's answers, the agent learns to score question candidates so as to pick up the most informative one for navigation, and meanwhile mimic oracle's answering. Thus, the agent can navigate in a self-Q&A manner even in real-world environment where the human assistance is often unavailable. Through joint optimization of communication and navigation in a unified imitation learning and reinforcement learning framework, SCoA asks a question if necessary and obtains a hint for guiding the agent to move towards the target with less communication cost.

Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) learn a continuous volumetric representation of a scene through multi-view consistency, and can be rendered from novel viewpoints by ray casting. While NeRF has an impressive ability to reconstruct geometry and fine details given many images, up to 100 for challenging 360 degree scenes, it often finds a degenerate solution to its image reconstruction objective when only a few input views are available. To improve few-shot quality, we propose DietNeRF. We introduce an auxiliary semantic consistency loss that encourages realistic renderings at novel poses. DietNeRF is trained on individual scenes to (1) correctly render given input views from the same pose, and (2) match high-level semantic attributes across different, random poses. Our semantic loss allows us to supervise DietNeRF from arbitrary poses. We extract these semantics using a pre-trained visual encoder such as CLIP, a Vision Transformer trained on hundreds of millions of diverse single-view, 2D photographs mined from the web with natural language supervision.

Based on the learned cross lines, we propose a crossline extraction module to adaptively capture features of cross lines. Furthermore, we design a decoupled regression mechanism to regress the localization along the horizontal and vertical directions respectively, which helps to decrease the optimization difficulty because the optimization space is limited to a specific direction.

We introduce transformer and multi-head attention to build a network with an encoder-decoder attention mechanism architecture that ""queries"" the given image with the language expression. Furthermore, we propose a Query Generation Module, which produces multiple sets of queries with different attention weights that represent the diversified comprehensions of the language expression from different aspects.

These unrealistic goals will result in an extremely narrow range of model capabilities, greatly limiting their use in real applications. To overcome these drawbacks, we re-design the benchmarks and propose the semantically coherent out-of-distribution detection (SC-OOD).

Hoi"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 9475-9484","Semi-supervised learning has been an effective paradigm for leveraging unlabeled data to reduce the reliance on labeled data. We propose CoMatch, a new semi-supervised learning method that unifies dominant approaches and addresses their limitations. CoMatch jointly learns two representations of the training data, their class probabilities and low-dimensional embeddings. The two representations interact with each other to jointly evolve. The embeddings impose a smoothness constraint on the class probabilities to improve the pseudo-labels, whereas the pseudo-labels regularize the structure of the embeddings through graph-based contrastive learning. CoMatch achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple datasets. It achieves substantial accuracy improvements on the label-scarce CIFAR-10 and STL-10. On ImageNet with 1% labels, CoMatch achieves a top-1 accuracy of 66.0%, outperforming FixMatch by 12.6%. Furthermore, CoMatch achieves better representation learning performance on downstream tasks, outperforming both supervised learning and self-supervised learning.

These multi-stage methods complicate the training, and also hinder the use of improved detectors for more accurate pseudo-labeling. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end approach to simultaneously improve the detector and pseudo labels gradually for semi-supervised object detection. The pseudo labels are generated on the fly by a teacher model which is an aggregated version of the student detector at different steps. As the detector becomes stronger during the training, the teacher detector's performance improves and the pseudo labels tend to be more accurate, which further benefits the detector training. Within the end-to-end training, we present two simple yet effective techniques: weigh the classification loss of unlabeled images through soft teacher and select reliable pseudo boxes for regression through box jittering.

Existing object-matching based methods focus on the matching between the raw object features of the current frame and the first/previous frames. However, two issues are still not solved by these object-matching based methods. As the appearance of the video object changes drastically over time, 1) unseen parts/details of the object present in the current frame, resulting in incomplete annotation in the first annotated frame (e.g., view/scale changes). 2) even for the seen parts/details of the object in the current frame, their positions change relatively (e.g., pose changes/camera motion), leading to a misalignment for the object matching. To obtain the complete information of the target object, we propose a novel object-based dynamic memory network that exploits visual contents of all the past frames.

Another approach is to concatenate all the modalities into a tuple and then contrast positive and negative tuple correspondences. However, that approach could consider only the stronger modalities while ignoring the weaker ones. To address these issues, we propose a novel contrastive learning objective, TupleInfoNCE. It contrasts tuples based not only on positive and negative correspondences, but also by composing new negative tuples using modalities describing different scenes. Training with these additional negatives encourages the learning model to examine the correspondences among modalities in the same tuple, ensuring that weak modalities are not ignored. We provide a theoretical justification based on mutual-information for why this approach works, and we propose a sample optimization algorithm to generate positive and negative samples to maximize training efficacy.

We consider a challenging problem of compositional generalization that emerges in this task due to a long tail data distribution. Current scene graph generation models are trained on a tiny fraction of the distribution corresponding to the most frequent compositions, e.g. <cup, on, table>. However, test images might contain zero- and few-shot compositions of objects and relationships, e.g. <cup, on, surfboard>. Despite each of the object categories and the predicate (e.g. 'on') being frequent in the training data, the models often fail to properly understand such unseen or rare compositions. To improve generalization, it is natural to attempt increasing the diversity of the training distribution. However, in the graph domain this is non-trivial. To that end, we propose a method to synthesize rare yet plausible scene graphs by perturbing real ones. We then propose and empirically study a model based on conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) that allows us to generate visual features of perturbed scene graphs and learn from them in a joint fashion.

Most exist attack methods focus on crafting adversarial examples in the digital domain, while only limited works study physical adversarial attack. However, it is more challenging to generate effective adversarial examples in the physical world due to many uncontrollable physical dynamics. Most current physical attack methods aim to generate robust physical adversarial examples by simulating all possible physical dynamics. When attacking new images or new DNN models, they require expensive manually efforts for simulating physical dynamics and considerable time for iteratively optimizing for each image. To tackle these issues, we propose a class-agnostic and model-agnostic physical adversarial attack model (Meta-Attack), which is able to not only generate robust physical adversarial examples by simulating color and shape distortions, but also generalize to attacking novel images and novel DNN models by accessing a few digital and physical images.

As different body parts behave differently during walking, it is intuitive to model the spatio-temporal patterns of each part separately. However, existing part-based methods equally divide the feature maps of each frame into fixed horizontal stripes to get local parts. It is obvious that these stripe partition-based methods cannot accurately locate the body parts. First, different body parts can appear at the same stripe (e.g., arms and the torso), and one part can appear at different stripes in different frames (e.g., hands). Second, different body parts possess different scales, and even the same part in different frames can appear at different locations and scales. Third, different parts also exhibit distinct movement patterns (e.g., at which frame the movement starts, the position change frequency, how long it lasts). To overcome these issues, we propose novel 3D local operations as a generic family of building blocks for 3D gait recognition backbones. The proposed 3D local operations support the extraction of local 3D volumes of body parts in a sequence with adaptive spatial and temporal scales, locations and lengths.

The quantization error of the PQ can be substantially improved in such combination since the residual vector space is much more quantization-friendly thanks to their compact distribution compared to the original data.

While great progress has been made in detecting generic or individual types of edges, it remains under-explored to comprehensively study all four edge types together. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network solution, RINDNet, to jointly detect all four types of edges. Taking into consideration the distinct attributes of each type of edges and the relationship between them, RINDNet learns effective representations for each of them and works in three stages. In stage I, RINDNet uses a common backbone to extract features shared by all edges. Then in stage II it branches to prepare discriminative features for each edge type by the corresponding decoder. In stage III, an independent decision head for each type aggregates the features from previous stages to predict the initial results. Additionally, an attention module learns attention maps for all types to capture the underlying relations between them, and these maps are combined with initial results to generate the final edge detection results. For training and evaluation, we construct the first public benchmark, BSDS-RIND, with all four types of edges carefully annotated. In our experiments, RINDNet yields promising results in comparison with state-of-the-art methods.

A distinct characteristic in vehicle tracking is that the trajectories of vehicles are fairly smooth in both the world coordinate and the image coordinate. Hence, models that capture motion consistencies are of high necessity. However, tracking with the standalone motion-based trackers is quite challenging because targets could get lost easily due to limited information, detection error and occlusion. Leveraging appearance information to assist object re-identification could resolve this challenge to some extent. However, doing so requires extra computation while appearance information is sensitive to occlusion as well. In this paper, we try to explore the significance of motion patterns for vehicle tracking without appearance information. We propose a novel approach that tackles the association issue for long-term tracking with the exclusive fully-exploited motion information. We address the tracklet embedding issue with the proposed reconstruct-to-embed strategy based on deep graph convolutional neural networks (GCN). Comprehensive experiments on the KITTI-car tracking dataset and UA-Detrac dataset show that the proposed method, though without appearance information, could achieve competitive performance with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) trackers.

This generated a distorted impression about the superiority of Pseudo-LiDAR-based (PL-based) approaches over methods working with RGB images only. Our first contribution consists in rectifying this view by pointing out and showing experimentally that the validation results published by PL-based methods are substantially biased. The source of the bias resides in an overlap between the KITTI3D object detection validation set and the training/validation sets used to train depth predictors feeding PL-based methods. Surprisingly, the bias remains also after geographically removing the overlap. This leaves the test set as the only reliable set for comparison, where published PL-based methods do not excel. Our second contribution brings PL-based methods back up in the ranking with the design of a novel deep architecture which introduces a 3D confidence prediction module. We show that 3D confidence estimation techniques derived from RGB-only 3D detection approaches can be successfully integrated into our framework and, more importantly, that improved performance can be obtained with a newly designed 3D confidence measure, leading to state-of-the-art performance on the KITTI3D benchmark.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Simonelli_Are_We_Missing_Confidence_in_Pseudo-LiDAR_Methods_for_Monocular_3D_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

Re-localisation benchmarks thus measure how well each method replicates the results of the reference algorithm. This begs the question whether the choice of the reference algorithm favours a certain family of re-localisation methods. This paper analyzes two widely used re-localisation datasets and shows that evaluation outcomes indeed vary with the choice of the reference algorithm. We thus question common beliefs in the re-localisation literature, namely that learning-based scene coordinate regression outperforms classical feature-based methods, and that RGB-D- based methods outperform RGB-based methods.

The proposed approach relies on an orientation-lifting strategy, by which a planar curve can be mapped to an high-dimensional orientation space. The convexity shape prior serves as a constraint for the construction of local metrics. The geodesic curves in the lifted space then can be efficiently computed through the fast marching method.

Existing solutions either attentively fuse deep style feature into deep content feature without considering feature distributions, or adaptively normalize deep content feature according to the style such that their global statistic information is matched. Although effective, leaving shallow feature unexplored or without locally considering feature statistics, they are prone to suffer from unnatural output with unpleasing local distortions. To alleviate this problem, in this paper, we propose a novel Adaptive Attention Normalization (AdaAttN) module to adaptively perform attentive normalization on per-point basis. Specifically, spatial attention score is learnt from both shallow and deep features of content and style images. Then per-point weighted statistics are calculated by regarding a style feature point as a distribution of attention-weighted output of all style feature points. Finally, the content feature is normalized so that they demonstrate the same local feature statistics as the calculated per-point weighted style feature statistics. Besides, a novel local feature loss is derived based on AdaAttN to enhance local visual quality. We also extend AdaAttN to be ready for video style transfer with slight modifications.

Previous approaches are built on top of image matting models, which fail in maintaining the temporal coherence when being adapted to videos. They either utilize the optical flow to smooth frame-wise prediction, where the performance is dependent on the selected optical flow model; or naively combine feature maps from multiple frames, which does not model well the correspondence of pixels in adjacent frames. In this paper, we propose to enhance the temporal coherence by Consistency-Regularized Graph Neural Networks (CRGNN) with the aid of a synthesized video matting dataset. CRGNN utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to relate adjacent frames such that pixels or regions that are incorrectly predicted in one frame can be corrected by leveraging information from its neighboring frames. To generalize our model from synthesized videos to real-world videos, we propose a consistency regularization technique to enforce the consistency on the alpha and foreground when blending them with different backgrounds. To evaluate the efficacy of CRGNN, we further collect a real-world dataset with annotated alpha mattes.

Inverting a Rolling Shutter Camera: Bring Rolling Shutter Images to High Framerate Global Shutter Video,"Bin Fan, Yuchao Dai"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 4228-4237","Rolling shutter (RS) images can be viewed as the result of the row-wise combination of global shutter (GS) images captured by a virtual moving GS camera over the period of camera readout time. The RS effect brings tremendous difficulties for the downstream applications. In this paper, we propose to invert the above RS imaging mechanism, i.e., recovering a high framerate GS video from consecutive RS images to achieve RS temporal super-resolution (RSSR). This extremely challenging problem, e.g., recovering 1440 GS images from two 720-height RS images, is far from being solved end-to-end. To address this challenge, we exploit the geometric constraint in the RS camera model, thus achieving geometry-aware inversion. Specifically, we make three contributions in resolving the above difficulties: (i) formulating the bidirectional RS undistortion flows under the constant velocity motion model, (ii) building the connection between the RS undistortion flow and optical flow via a scaling operation, and (iii) developing a mutual conversion scheme between varying RS undistortion flows that correspond to different scanlines. Building upon these formulations, we propose the first RS temporal super-resolution network in a cascaded structure to extract high framerate global shutter video. Our method explores the underlying spatio-temporal geometric relationships within a deep learning framework, where no extra supervision besides the middle-scanline ground truth GS image is needed. Essentially, our method can be very efficient for explicit propagation to generate GS images under any scanline.

Channel pruning is one important compression strategy, and widely used in slimming various DNNs. Previous gate-based or importance-based pruning methods aim to remove channels whose ""importance"" are smallest. However, it remains unclear what criteria the channel importance should be measured on, leading to various channel selection heuristics. Some other sampling-based pruning methods deploy sampling strategy to train sub-nets, which often causes the training instability and the compressed model's degraded performance. In view of the research gaps, we present a new module named Gates with Differentiable Polarization (GDP), inspired by principled optimization ideas. GDP can be plugged before convolutional layers without bells and whistles, to control the on-and-off of each channel or whole layer block. During the training process, the polarization effect will drive a subset of gates to smoothly decrease to exactly zero, while other gates gradually stay away from zero by a large margin. When training terminates, those zero-gated channels can be painlessly removed, while other non-zero gates can be absorbed into the succeeding convolution kernel, causing completely no interruption to training nor damage to the trained model. Experiments conducted over CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets show that the proposed GDP algorithm achieves the state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark DNNs at a broad range of pruning ratios.

Qi, Dragomir Anguelov"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 15446-15456","In autonomous driving, a LiDAR-based object detector should perform reliably at different geographic locations and under various weather conditions. While recent 3D detection research focuses on improving performance within a single domain, our study reveals that the performance of modern detectors can drop drastically cross-domain. In this paper, we investigate unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) for LiDAR-based 3D object detection. On the Waymo Domain Adaptation dataset, we identify the deteriorating point cloud quality as the root cause of the performance drop. To address this issue, we present Semantic Point Generation (SPG), a general approach to enhance the reliability of LiDAR detectors against domain shifts. Specifically, SPG generates semantic points at the predicted foreground regions and faithfully recovers missing parts of the foreground objects, which are caused by phenomena such as occlusions, low reflectance, or weather interference. By merging the semantic points with the original points, we obtain an augmented point cloud, which can be directly consumed by modern LiDAR-based detectors. To validate the wide applicability of SPG, we experiment with two representative detectors, PointPillars and PV-RCNN.

Extreme-Quality Computational Imaging via Degradation Framework,"Shiqi Chen, Huajun Feng, Keming Gao, Zhihai Xu, Yueting Chen"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 2632-2641","To meet the space limitation of optical elements, free-form surfaces or high-order aspherical lenses are adopted in mobile cameras to compress volume. However, the application of free-form surfaces also introduces the problem of image quality mutation. Existing model-based deconvolution methods are inefficient in dealing with the degradation that shows a wide range of spatial variants over regions. And the deep learning techniques in low-level and physics-based vision suffer from a lack of accurate data. To address this issue, we develop a degradation framework to estimate the spatially variant point spread functions (PSFs) of mobile cameras. When input extreme-quality digital images, the proposed framework generates degraded images sharing a common domain with real-world photographs. Supplied with the synthetic image pairs, we design a Field-Of-View shared kernel prediction network (FOV-KPN) to perform spatial-adaptive reconstruction on real degraded photos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves extreme-quality computational imaging and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.

Direct Differentiable Augmentation Search,"Aoming Liu, Zehao Huang, Zhiwu Huang, Naiyan Wang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 12219-12228","Data augmentation has been an indispensable tool to improve the performance of deep neural networks, however the augmentation can hardly transfer among different tasks and datasets. Consequently, a recent trend is to adopt AutoML technique to learn proper augmentation policy without extensive hand-crafted tuning. In this paper, we propose an efficient differentiable search algorithm called Direct Differentiable Augmentation Search (DDAS). It utilizes meta-learning with one-step gradient update and continuous relaxation to the expected training loss for efficient search. Our DDAS could achieve efficient augmentation search without approximations such as Gumbel-Softmax or second order gradient approximation. To further reduce the adverse effect of improper augmentations, we organize the search space into a two level hierarchy, in which we first decide whether to apply augmentation, and then determine the specific augmentation policy. On standard image classification benchmarks, our DDAS achieves state-of-the-art performance and efficiency tradeoff while reducing the search cost dramatically, e.g. 0.15 GPU hours for CIFAR-10. In addition, we also use DDAS to search augmentation for object detection task and achieve comparable performance with AutoAugment, while being 1000x faster.

The Functional Correspondence Problem,"Zihang Lai, Senthil Purushwalkam, Abhinav Gupta"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 15772-15781","The ability to find correspondences in visual data is the essence of most computer vision tasks. But what are the right correspondences? The task of visual correspondence is well defined for two different images of same object instance. In case of two images of objects belonging to same category, visual correspondence is reasonably well-defined in most cases. But what about correspondence between two objects of completely different category -- e.g., a shoe and a bottle? Does there exist any correspondence? Inspired by humans' ability to: (a) generalize beyond semantic categories and; (b) infer functional affordances, we introduce the problem of functional correspondences in this paper. Given images of two objects, we ask a simple question: what is the set of correspondences between these two images for a given task? For example, what are the correspondences between a bottle and shoe for the task of pounding or the task of pouring. We introduce a new dataset: FunKPoint that has ground truth correspondences for 10 tasks and 20 object categories. We also introduce a modular task-driven representation for attacking this problem and demonstrate that our learned representation is effective for this task. But most importantly, because our supervision signal is not bound by semantics, we show that our learned representation can generalize better on few-shot classification problem.

To address the above problem, in this paper, we propose two disjoint data-generation ways to complement existing training samples to improve the robustness of Re-ID models.

However, existing localization based methods relying on intermediate representations (i.e., density maps or pseudo boxes) serving as learning targets are counter-intuitive and error-prone. In this paper, we propose a purely point-based framework for joint crowd counting and individual localization. For this framework, instead of merely reporting the absolute counting error at image level, we propose a new metric, called density Normalized Average Precision (nAP), to provide more comprehensive and more precise performance evaluation. Moreover, we design an intuitive solution under this framework, which is called Point to Point Network (P2PNet). P2PNet discards superfluous steps and directly predicts a set of point proposals to represent heads in an image, being consistent with the human annotation results. By thorough analysis, we reveal the key step towards implementing such a novel idea is to assign optimal learning targets for these proposals. Therefore, we propose to conduct this crucial association in an one-to-one matching manner using the Hungarian algorithm.

The task of identifying the main speaker (who is properly taking his/her turn of speaking) and the interrupters (who are interrupting or reacting to the main speaker's utterances) remains a challenging task. Although some prior methods have partially addressed this task, there still remain some limitations. Firstly, a direct association of Audio and Visual features may limit the correlations to be extracted due to different modalities. Secondly, the relationship across temporal segments helping to maintain the consistency of localization, separation and conversation contexts is not effectively exploited. Finally, the interactions between speakers that usually contain the tracking and anticipatory decisions about transition to a new speaker is usually ignored. Therefore, this work introduces a new Audio-Visual Transformer approach to the problem of localization and highlighting the main speaker in both audio and visual channels of a multi-speaker conversation video in the wild. The proposed method exploits different types of correlations presented in both visual and audio signals. The temporal audio-visual relationships across spatial-temporal space are anticipated and optimized via the self-attention mechanism in a Transformer structure.

Despite the great progress, current methods still have limitations in preserving fine spatial details for optimal reconstruction, especially at low compression rates. We make three contributions in tackling this issue. First, we develop a novel back projection method with attentional and multi-scale feature fusion for augmented representation power. Our back projection method recalibrates the current estimation by establishing feedback connections between high-level and low-level attributes in an attentional and discriminative manner. Second, we propose to decompose the input image and separately process the distinct frequency components, whose derived latents are recombined using a novel dual attention module, so that details inside regions of interest could be explicitly manipulated.

In this paper we describe a new tone-mapping approach guided by the distinct goal of producing low dynamic range (LDR) renditions that best reproduce the visual characteristics of native LDR images. This goal enables the use of an unpaired adversarial training based on unrelated sets of HDR and LDR images, both of which are widely available and easy to acquire. In order to achieve an effective training under this minimal requirements, we introduce the following new steps and components: (i) a range-normalizing pre-process which estimates and applies a different level of curve-based compression, (ii) a loss that preserves the input content while allowing the network to achieve its goal, and (iii) the use of a more concise discriminator network, designed to promote the reproduction of low-level attributes native LDR possess.

As a typical example, the Vision Transformer (ViT) directly applies a pure transformer architecture on image classification, by simply splitting images into tokens with a fixed length, and employing transformers to learn relations between these tokens. However, such naive tokenization could destruct object structures, assign grids to uninterested regions such as background, and introduce interference signals. To mitigate the above issues, in this paper, we propose an iterative and progressive sampling strategy to locate discriminative regions. At each iteration, embeddings of the current sampling step are fed into a transformer encoder layer, and a group of sampling offsets is predicted to update the sampling locations for the next step. The progressive sampling is differentiable. When combined with the Vision Transformer, the obtained PS-ViT network can adaptively learn where to look. The proposed PS-ViT is both effective and efficient. When trained from scratch on ImageNet, PS-ViT performs 3.8% higher than the vanilla ViT in terms of top-1 accuracy with about 4x fewer parameters and 10x fewer FLOPs.

Unlike prior cross-camera color constancy models, which are usually designed to be agnostic to the spectral properties of test-set images from unobserved cameras, C5 approaches this problem through the lens of transductive inference: additional unlabeled images are provided as input to the model at test time, which allows the model to calibrate itself to the spectral properties of the test-set camera during inference. C5 achieves state-of-the-art accuracy for cross-camera color constancy on several datasets, is fast to evaluate ( 7 and 90 ms per image on a GPU or CPU, respectively), and requires little memory ( 2 MB), and thus is a practical solution to the problem of calibration-free automatic white balance for mobile photography.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Afifi_Cross-Camera_Convolutional_Color_Constancy_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

However, working in hyperbolic spaces is not without difficulties as a result of its curved geometry (e.g., computing the Frechet mean of a set of points requires an iterative algorithm). Furthermore, in Euclidean spaces, one can resort to kernel machines that not only enjoy rich theoretical properties but that can also lead to superior representational power (e.g., infinite-width neural networks). In this paper, we introduce positive definite kernel functions for hyperbolic spaces. This brings in two major advantages, 1. kernelization will pave the way to seamlessly benefit from kernel machines in conjunction with hyperbolic embeddings, and 2. the rich structure of the Hilbert spaces associated with kernel machines enables us to simplify various operations involving hyperbolic data. That said, identifying valid kernel functions on curved spaces is not straightforward and is indeed considered an open problem in the learning community. Our work addresses this gap and develops several valid positive definite kernels in hyperbolic spaces, including the universal ones (e.g., RBF).

On one hand, without explicit annotation, the scale of 3D pose is difficult to be accurately captured (scale ambiguity). On the other hand, one 2D pose might correspond to multiple 3D gestures, where the lifting procedure is inherently ambiguous (pose ambiguity). Previous methods generally use temporal constraints (e.g., constant bone length and motion smoothness) to alleviate the above issues. However, these methods commonly enforce the outputs to fulfill multiple training objectives simultaneously, which often lead to sub-optimal results. In contrast to the majority of previous works, we propose to split the whole problem into two sub-tasks, i.e., optimizing 2D input poses via a scale estimation module and then mapping optimized 2D pose to 3D counterpart via a pose lifting module. Furthermore, two temporal constraints are proposed to alleviate the scale and pose ambiguity respectively. These two modules are optimized via a iterative training scheme with corresponding temporal constraints, which effectively reduce the learning difficulty and lead to better performance.

Further, collecting massive data for novel categories is expensive. To address this demand, in this paper, we propose a unified framework towards Few-sample Lifelong Active Recognition (FLAR), which aims at performing active recognition on progressively arising novel categories that only have few training samples. Three difficulties emerge with FLAR: the lifelong recognition policy learning, the knowledge preservation of old categories, and the lack of training samples. To this end, our approach integrates prototypes, a robust representation for limited training samples, into a reinforcement learning solution, which motivates the agent to move towards views resulting in more discriminative features. Catastrophic forgetting during lifelong learning is then alleviated with knowledge distillation.

There is great interest in building models that are able to learn similar structure, ideally in an unsupervised manner. Learning such structure from complex 3D scenes that include clutter, occlusions, interactions, and camera motion is still an open challenge. We present a model that is able to segment visual scenes from complex 3D environments into distinct objects, learn disentangled representations of individual objects, and form consistent and coherent predictions of future frames, in a fully unsupervised manner. Our model (named PARTS) builds on recent approaches that utilize iterative amortized inference and transition dynamics for deep generative models. We achieve dramatic improvements in performance by introducing several novel contributions. We introduce a recurrent slot-attention like encoder which allows for top-down influence during inference. Unlike prior work, we eschew using an auto-regressive prior when modeling image sequences, and demonstrate that a fixed frame-independent prior is superior for the purpose of scene segmentation and representation learning. We demonstrate our model's success on three different video datasets (the popular benchmark CLEVRER; a simulated 3D Playroom environment; and a real-world Robotics Arm dataset).

Recent advances in visual localization have demonstrated their feasibility in large-scale indoor spaces through coarse-to-fine methods that typically employ three steps: image retrieval, pose estimation, and pose selection. However, further research is needed to improve the accuracy of large-scale indoor visual localization. We demonstrate that the limitations in the previous methods can be attributed to the sparsity of image positions in the database, which causes view-differences between a query and a retrieved image from the database. In this paper, to address this problem, we propose a novel module, named pose correction, that enables re-estimation of the pose with local feature matching in a similar view by reorganizing the local features.

Firstly, we design the network of ML-MemAE-SC (Multi-Level Memory modules in an Autoencoder with Skip Connections) to memorize normal patterns for optical flow reconstruction so that abnormal events can be sensitively identified with larger flow reconstruction errors. More importantly, conditioned on the reconstructed flows, we then employ a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which captures the high correlation between video frame and optical flow, to predict the next frame given several previous frames. By CVAE, the quality of flow reconstruction essentially influences that of frame prediction.

However, recently several works raise the security issues of 3D deep models. Although most of them consider adversarial attacks, we identify that backdoor attack is indeed a more serious threat to 3D deep learning systems but remains unexplored. We present the backdoor attacks in 3D point cloud with a unified framework that exploits the unique properties of 3D data and networks. In particular, we design two attack approaches on point cloud: the poison-label backdoor attack (PointPBA) and the clean-label backdoor attack (PointCBA). The first one is straightforward and effective in practice, while the latter is more sophisticated assuming there are certain data inspections. The attack algorithms are mainly motivated and developed by 1) the recent discovery of 3D adversarial samples suggesting the vulnerability of deep models under spatial transformation; 2) the proposed feature disentanglement technique that manipulates the feature of the data through optimization methods and its potential to embed a new task. Extensive experiments show the efficacy of the PointPBA with over 95% success rate across various 3D datasets and models, and the more stealthy PointCBA with around 50% success rate.

Inspired by the fact that humans can recognize novel concepts by composing existed concepts and capsule network's ability of representing part-whole hierarchies, we propose to use capsules to represent parts and introduce ""Linguistically Routing"" to merge parts with human-prior hierarchies. Specifically, we first fuse visual features with a single question word as atomic parts. Then we introduce the ""Linguistically Routing"" to reweight the capsule connections between two layers such that: 1) the lower layer capsules can transfer their outputs to the most compatible higher capsules, and 2) two capsules can be merged if their corresponding words are merged in the question parse tree. The routing process maximizes the above unary and binary potentials across multiple layers and finally carves a tree structure inside the capsule network. We evaluate our proposed routing method on the CLEVR compositional generation test, the VQA-CP2 dataset and the VQAv2 dataset.

While recent advances in 3D implicit representation have made it possible to learn models of complex objects, learning pose-controllable representations of articulated objects remains a challenge, as current methods require 3D shape supervision and are unable to render appearance. In formulating an implicit representation of 3D articulated objects, our method considers only the rigid transformation of the most relevant object part in solving for the radiance field at each 3D location. In this way, the proposed method represents pose-dependent changes without significantly increasing the computational complexity. NARF is fully differentiable and can be trained from images with pose annotations. Moreover, through the use of an autoencoder, it can learn appearance variations over multiple instances of an object class.

While existing work has largely focused on learning global representations for an entire image, ReSim learns both regional representations for localization as well as semantic image-level representations. ReSim operates by sliding a fixed-sized window across the overlapping area between two views (e.g., image crops), aligning these areas with their corresponding convolutional feature map regions, and then maximizing the feature similarity across views. As a result, ReSim learns spatially and semantically consistent feature representation throughout the convolutional feature maps of a neural network. A shift or scale of an image region, e.g., a shift or scale of an object, has a corresponding change in the feature maps; this allows downstream tasks to leverage these representations for localization. Through object detection, instance segmentation, and dense pose estimation experiments, we illustrate how ReSim learns representations which significantly improve the localization and classification performance compared to a competitive MoCo-v2 baseline: +2:7 APbb75 VOC, +1:1 AP75 COCO, and +1:9 APmk Cityscapes.

This has mostly addressed the design of architectures, typically by adding parameters and increasing model complexity. However, visual relation learning is a long-tailed problem, due to the combinatorial nature of joint reasoning about groups of objects. Increasing model complexity is, in general, ill-suited for long-tailed problems due to their tendency to overfit. In this paper, we explore an alternative hypothesis, denoted the Devil is in the Tails. Under this hypothesis, better performance is achieved by keeping the model simple but improving its ability to cope with long-tailed distributions. To test this hypothesis, we devise a new approach for training visual relationships models, which is inspired by state-of-the-art long-tailed recognition literature. This is based on an iterative decoupled training scheme, denoted Decoupled Training for Devil in the Tails (DT2). DT2 employs a novel sampling approach, Alternating Class-Balanced Sampling (ACBS), to capture the interplay between the long-tailed entity and predicate distributions of visual relations. Results show that, with an extremely simple architecture, DT2-ACBS significantly outperforms much more complex state-of-the-art methods on scene graph generation tasks.

Such simple synthetic degradation models, however, cannot well describe the complex degradation processes in real-world videos, and thus the trained VSR models become ineffective in real-world applications. As an attempt to bridge the gap, we build a real-world video super-resolution (RealVSR) dataset by capturing paired LR-HR video sequences using the multi-camera system of iPhone 11 Pro Max. Since the LR-HR video pairs are captured by two separate cameras, there are inevitably certain misalignment and luminance/color differences between them.

However, their differentiable rasterization based image formation models, as well as underlying scene parameterization, limit them to Lambertian face reflectance and to poor shape details.

Recent approaches combine monocular depth networks with inpainting networks to achieve compelling results. A drawback of these techniques is the use of hard depth layering, making them unable to model intricate appearance details such as thin hair-like structures. We present SLIDE, a modular and unified system for single image 3D photography that uses a simple yet effective soft layering strategy to better preserve appearance details in novel views. In addition, we propose a novel depth-aware training strategy for our inpainting module, better suited for the 3D photography task. The resulting SLIDE approach is modular, enabling the use of other components such as segmentation and matting for improved layering. At the same time, SLIDE uses an efficient layered depth formulation that only requires a single forward pass through the component networks to produce high quality 3D photos. Extensive experimental analysis on three view-synthesis datasets, in combination with user studies on in-the-wild image collections, demonstrate superior performance of our technique in comparison to existing strong baselines while being conceptually much simpler.

Lightweight student networks are trained by extra supervision transferred from large teacher networks. Most previous KD variants for dense prediction tasks align the activation maps from the student and teacher network in the spatial domain, typically by normalizing the activation values on each spatial location and minimizing point-wise and/or pair-wise discrepancy. Different from the previous methods, here we propose to normalize the activation map of each channel to obtain a soft probability map. By simply minimizing the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence between the channel-wise probability map of the two networks, the distillation process pays more attention to the most salient regions of each channel, which are valuable for dense prediction tasks.

However, current models are stuck in common predicates, e.g., ""on"" and ""at"", rather than informative ones, e.g., ""standing on"" and ""looking at"", resulting in the loss of precise information and overall performance. If a model only uses ""stone on road"" rather than ""blocking"" to describe an image, it is easy to misunderstand the scene. We argue that this phenomenon is caused by two key imbalances between informative predicates and common ones, i.e., semantic space level imbalance and training sample level imbalance. To tackle this problem, we propose BA-SGG, a simple yet effective SGG framework based on balance adjustment but not the conventional distribution fitting.

Contrary to recent approaches that model image layers with autoencoder networks, we represent them as explicit transformations of a small set of prototypical images. Our model has three main components: (i) a set of object prototypes in the form of learnable images with a transparency channel, which we refer to as sprites; (ii) differentiable parametric functions predicting occlusions and transformation parameters necessary to instantiate the sprites in a given image; (iii) a layered image formation model with occlusion for compositing these instances into complete images including background. By jointly learning the sprites and occlusion/transformation predictors to reconstruct images, our approach not only yields accurate layered image decompositions, but also identifies object categories and instance parameters. We first validate our approach by providing results on par with the state of the art on standard multi-object synthetic benchmarks (Tetrominoes, Multi-dSprites, CLEVR6). We then demonstrate the applicability of our model to real images in tasks that include clustering (SVHN, GTSRB), cosegmentation (Weizmann Horse) and object discovery from unfiltered social network images.

An alternative is the assumption of local style patterns, where algorithms are designed to swap similar local features of content and style images. However, the limitation of these existing methods is that they neglect the semantic structure of the content image which may lead to corrupted content structure in the output. In this paper, we make a new assumption that image features from the same semantic region form a manifold and an image with multiple semantic regions follows a multi-manifold distribution. Based on this assumption, the style transfer problem is formulated as aligning two multi-manifold distributions and a Manifold Alignment based Style Transfer (MAST) framework is proposed. The proposed framework allows semantically similar regions between the output and the style image share similar style patterns. Moreover, the proposed manifold alignment method is flexible to allow user editing or using semantic segmentation maps as guidance for style transfer.

The proposed method employs two point samplers based on deep neural networks, the object sampler and the background sampler. The former targets at sampling points of common objects while the latter focuses on the rest. The mutual attention module explores point-wise correlation across point clouds. It is embedded in both samplers and can identify points with strong cross-cloud correlation from the rest.

However, the whole rotation space is quite redundant for solving the MF rotation, which is one of the main factors that disturb the computational efficiency of those methods associated with a rotation space search. This paper proves that the volume of the space that just contains all MF rotations (called the ""MFR space"") is only 1 / 24 of that of the whole rotation space, and then an exact MFR space is delimited from the rotation space.

This is technically challenging, as it requires a scalable verifier tailored to point cloud models that handles a wide range of semantic 3D transformations. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce 3DCertify, the first verifier able to certify the robustness of point cloud models. 3DCertify is based on two key insights: (i) a generic relaxation based on first-order Taylor approximations, applicable to any differentiable transformation, and (ii) a precise relaxation for global feature pooling, which is more complex than pointwise activations (e.g., ReLU or sigmoid) but commonly employed in point cloud models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of 3DCertify by performing an extensive evaluation on a wide range of 3D transformations (e.g., rotation, twisting) for both classification and part segmentation tasks. For example, we can certify robustness against rotations by +-60deg for 95.7% of point clouds, and our max pool relaxation increases certification by up to 15.6%.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Lorenz_Robustness_Certification_for_Point_Cloud_Models_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

The square root formulation pervades three major aspects of our optimization-based sliding-window estimator: for bundle adjustment we eliminate landmark variables with nullspace projection; to store the marginalization prior we employ a matrix square root of the Hessian; and when marginalizing old poses we avoid forming normal equations and update the square root prior directly with a specialized QR decomposition. We show that the proposed square root marginalization is algebraically equivalent to the conventional use of Schur complement (SC) on the Hessian. Moreover, it elegantly deals with rank-deficient Jacobians producing a prior equivalent to SC with Moore--Penrose inverse. Our evaluation of visual and visual-inertial odometry on real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed estimator is 36% faster than the baseline. It furthermore shows that in single precision, conventional Hessian-based marginalization leads to numeric failures and reduced accuracy.

Such methods sustain two main limitations. (1) The label noise may hinder the learning of discriminative features for recognizing target classes.

Unlike traditional cameras, event cameras have very low latency (microseconds vs milliseconds) very high dynamic range (140dB vs 60 dB), and low power consumption, as they report changes of a scene and not a complete frame. As they re-port per pixel feature-like events and not the whole intensity frame they are immune to motion blur. However, event cameras require movement between the scene and camera to fire events ,i.e., they have no output when the scene is relatively static. Traditional cameras, however, report the whole frame of pixels at once in fixed intervals but have lower dynamic range and are prone to motion blur in case of rapid movements. We get the best from both worlds and use events and intensity images together in our complementary design and estimate dense disparity from this combination. The proposed end-to-end design combines events and images in a sequential manner and correlates them to esti-mate dense depth values. Our various experimental settings in real-world and simulated scenarios exploit the superiority of our method in predicting accurate depth values with fine details.

To this end, this paper explores a novel frequency-aware dynamic network for dividing the input into multiple parts according to its coefficients in the discrete cosine transform (DCT) domain. In practice, the high-frequency part will be processed using expensive operations and the lower-frequency part is assigned with cheap operations to relieve the computation burden.

Existing methods use transfer learning for I2I translation, but they still require the learning of millions of parameters from scratch. This drawback severely limits its application on small domains. In this paper, we propose a new transfer learning for I2I translation (TransferI2I). We decouple our learning process into the image generation step and the I2I translation step. In the first step we propose two novel techniques: source-target initialization and self-initialization of the adaptor layer. The former finetunes the pretrained generative model (e.g., StyleGAN) on source and target data. The latter allows to initialize all non-pretrained network parameters without the need of any data. These techniques provide a better initialization for the I2I translation. Second step performs the actual I2I translation using the learned weights in the first step. In addition, we introduce an auxiliary GAN that further facilitates the training of deep I2I systems even from small datasets.

In contrast, our approach matches perturbed image `distribution' with that of the target class, leading to high targeted transferability rates. To this end, we propose a new objective function that not only aligns the global distributions of source and target images, but also matches the local neighbourhood structure between the two domains.

Based on these hierarchical representations, our model can refer to the overall context of the entire video, and predict how the segment labels that are out of context should be corrected.

Using an analysis-by-synthesis approach, we design a novel GAN architecture to synthesize a multiple-instance depth image with independent control over each instance. InSeGAN takes in a set of code vectors (e.g., random noise vectors), each encoding the 3D pose of an object that is represented by a learned implicit object template. The generator has two distinct modules. The first module, the instance feature generator, uses each encoded pose to transform the implicit template into a feature map representation of each object instance. The second module, the depth image renderer, aggregates all of the single-instance feature maps output by the first module and generates a multiple-instance depth image. A discriminator distinguishes the generated multiple-instance depth images from the distribution of true depth images.

The range-based view is regular and generally dense, however spherical projection makes physical dimensions distorted. Both voxel- and range-based views suffer from quantization loss, especially for voxels when facing large-scale scenes. In order to utilize different view's advantages and alleviate their own shortcomings in fine-grained segmentation task, we propose a novel range-point-voxel fusion network, namely RPVNet.

In doing so, it addresses some of the limitations of the state-of-the-art works, namely, a) that they discover directions that are independent of the latent code, i.e., paths that are linear, and b) that their evaluation relies either on visual inspection or on laborious human labeling. More specifically, we propose to learn non-linear warpings on the latent space, each one parametrized by a set of RBF-based latent space warping functions, and where each warping gives rise to a family of non-linear paths via the gradient of the function. Building on the work of Voynov and Babenko, that discovers linear paths, we optimize the trainable parameters of the set of RBFs, so as that images that are generated by codes along different paths, are easily distinguishable by a discriminator network. This leads to easily distinguishable image transformations, such as pose and facial expressions in facial images. We show that linear paths can be derived as a special case of our method, and show experimentally that non-linear paths in the latent space lead to steeper, more disentangled and interpretable changes in the image space than in state-of-the art methods, both qualitatively and quantitatively.

At test time, given a single unposed image of an unseen object, CodeNeRF jointly estimates camera viewpoint, and shape and appearance codes via optimization. Unseen objects can be reconstructed from a single image, and then rendered from new viewpoints or their shape and texture edited by varying the latent codes. We conduct experiments on the SRN benchmark, which show that CodeNeRF generalises well to unseen objects and achieves on-par performance with methods that require known camera pose at test time.

Moreover, instances belonging to different IDs on different frames, rather than limited numbers of instances in raw consecutive frames, can be gathered to allow more effective hard example mining in the training of trackers.

Prior arts focus on tackling this task via warping clothes and fusing the information at the pixel level with the help of semantic segmentation. However, conducting semantic segmentation is time-consuming and easily causes error accumulation over time. Besides, warping the information at the pixel level instead of the feature level limits the performance (e.g., unable to generate different views) and is unstable since it directly demonstrates the results even with a misalignment. In contrast, fusing information at the feature level can be further refined by the convolution to obtain the final results. Based on these assumptions, we propose a co-attention feature-remapping framework, namely FashionMirror, that generates the try-on results according to the driven-pose sequence in two stages. In the first stage, we consider the source human image and the target try-on clothes to predict the removed mask and the try-on clothing mask, which replaces the pre-processed semantic segmentation and reduces the inference time. In the second stage, we first remove the clothes on the source human via the removed mask and warp the clothing features conditioning on the try-on clothing mask to fit the next frame human. Meanwhile, we predict the optical flows from the consecutive 2D poses and warp the source human to the next frame at the feature level. Then, we enhance the clothing features and source human features in every frame to generate realistic try-on results with spatio-temporal smoothness.

Reconcile Prediction Consistency for Balanced Object Detection,"Keyang Wang, Lei Zhang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 3631-3640","Classification and regression are two pillars of object detectors. In most CNN-based detectors, these two pillars are optimized independently. Without direct interactions between them, the classification loss and the regression loss can not be optimized synchronously toward the optimal direction in the training phase. This clearly leads to lots of inconsistent predictions with high classification score but low localization accuracy or low classification score but high localization accuracy in the inference phase, especially for the objects of irregular shape and occlusion, which severely hurts the detection performance of existing detectors after NMS. To reconcile prediction consistency for balanced object detection, we propose a Harmonic loss to harmonize the optimization of classification branch and localization branch. The Harmonic loss enables these two branches to supervise and promote each other during training, thereby producing consistent predictions with high co-occurrence of top classification and localization in the inference phase. Furthermore, in order to prevent the localization loss from being dominated by outliers during training phase, a Harmonic IoU loss is proposed to harmonize the weight of the localization loss of different IoU-level samples.

A third-party model can be poisoned such that it works adequately in normal conditions but behaves maliciously on samples with specific trigger patterns. However, the trigger injection function is manually defined in most existing backdoor attack methods, e.g., placing a small patch of pixels on an image or slightly deforming the image before poisoning the model. This results in a two-stage approach with a sub-optimal attack success rate and a lack of complete stealthiness under human inspection. In this paper, we propose a novel and stealthy backdoor attack framework, LIRA, which jointly learns the optimal, stealthy trigger injection function and poisons the model. We formulate such an objective as a non-convex, constrained optimization problem. Under this optimization framework, the trigger generator function will learn to manipulate the input with imperceptible noise to preserve the model performance on the clean data and maximize the attack success rate on the poisoned data. Then, we solve this challenging optimization problem with an efficient, two-stage stochastic optimization procedure.

Then, by estimating fine-tuning performance via an adaptive model by accumulating experience from the past tasks, an online schedule generator is proposed to pick up the most suitable model and generate a personalized training regime with respect to each desired task in a one-shot fashion. The resulting model zoo is more training efficient than SOTA NAS models, e.g. 6x faster than RegNetY-16GF, and 1.7x faster than EfficientNetB3.

RandomRooms: Unsupervised Pre-Training From Synthetic Shapes and Randomized Layouts for 3D Object Detection,"Yongming Rao, Benlin Liu, Yi Wei, Jiwen Lu, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Jie Zhou"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 3283-3292","3D point cloud understanding has made great progress in recent years. However, one major bottleneck is the scarcity of annotated real datasets, especially compared to 2D object detection tasks, since a large amount of labor is involved in annotating the real scans of a scene. A promising solution to this problem is to make better use of the synthetic dataset, which consists of CAD object models, to boost the learning on real datasets. This can be achieved by the pre-training and fine-tuning procedure. However, recent work on 3D pre-training exhibits failure when transfer features learned on synthetic objects to other real-world applications. In this work, we put forward a new method called RandomRooms to accomplish this objective. In particular, we propose to generate random layouts of a scene by making use of the objects in the synthetic CAD dataset and learn the 3D scene representation by applying object-level contrastive learning on two random scenes generated from the same set of synthetic objects. The model pre-trained in this way can serve as a better initialization when later fine-tuning on the 3D object detection task. Empirically, we show consistent improvement in downstream 3D detection tasks on several base models, especially when less training data are used, which strongly demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of our method. Benefiting from the rich semantic knowledge and diverse objects from synthetic data, our method establishes the new state-of-the-art on widely-used 3D detection benchmarks ScanNetV2 and SUN RGB-D.

From Continuity to Editability: Inverting GANs With Consecutive Images,"Yangyang Xu, Yong Du, Wenpeng Xiao, Xuemiao Xu, Shengfeng He"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 13910-13918","Existing GAN inversion methods are stuck in a paradox that the inverted codes can either achieve high-fidelity reconstruction, or retain the editing capability. Having only one of them clearly cannot realize real image editing. In this paper, we resolve this paradox by introducing consecutive images (e.g., video frames or the same person with different poses) into the inversion process. The rationale behind our solution is that the continuity of consecutive images leads to inherent editable directions. This inborn property is used for two unique purposes: 1) regularizing the joint inversion process, such that each of the inverted codes is semantically accessible from one of the other and fastened in an editable domain; 2) enforcing inter-image coherence, such that the fidelity of each inverted code can be maximized with the complement of other images. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our alternative significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction fidelity and editability on both the real image dataset and synthesis dataset. Furthermore, our method provides the first support of video-based GAN inversion and an interesting application of unsupervised semantic transfer from consecutive images.

We observe that spatial distractors appear consistently in a particular location, and temporal distractors show several patterns, e.g., partial occlusions occur in the first few frames, where such patterns provide informative cues for predicting which frames to focus on (i.e., temporal attentions).

To address these challenges, we propose GarmentNets, where the key idea is to formulate the deformable object pose estimation problem as a shape completion task in the canonical space. This canonical space is defined across garments instances within a category, therefore, specifies the shared category-level pose. By mapping the observed partial surface to the canonical space and completing it in this space, the output representation describes the garment's full configuration using a complete 3D mesh with the per-vertex canonical coordinate label.

To overcome such limitations, we deviate from the existing input-space-based adversarial training regime and propose a single-step latent adversarial training method (SLAT), which leverages the gradients of latent representation as the latent adversarial perturbation. We demonstrate that the L1 norm of feature gradients is implicitly regularized through the adopted latent perturbation, thereby recovering local linearity and ensuring reliable performance, compared to the existing single-step adversarial training methods. Because latent perturbation is based on the gradients of the latent representations which can be obtained for free in the process of input gradients computation, the proposed method costs roughly the same time as the fast gradient sign method.

These cases happen when a model exploits spurious statistical regularities to produce correct answers but does not actually deploy the desired behavior. There is a need to identify possible shortcuts in a dataset and assess their use before deploying a model in the real world. The research community in VQA has focused exclusively on question-based shortcuts, where a model might, for example, answer ""What is the color of the sky"" with ""blue"" by relying mostly on the question-conditional training prior and give little weight to visual evidence. We go a step further and consider multimodal shortcuts that involve both questions and images. We first identify potential shortcuts in the popular VQA v2 training set by mining trivial predictive rules such as co-occurrences of words and visual elements. We then introduce VQA-CounterExamples (VQA-CE), an evaluation protocol based on our subset of CounterExamples i.e. image-question-answer triplets where our rules lead to incorrect answers. We use this new evaluation in a large-scale study of existing approaches for VQA. We demonstrate that even state-of-the-art models perform poorly and that existing techniques to reduce biases are largely ineffective in this context.

In this paper, we tackle these limitations for the specific problem of few-shot full 3D head reconstruction, by endowing coordinate-based representations with a probabilistic shape prior that enables faster convergence and better generalization when using few input images (down to three). First, we learn a shape model of 3D heads from thousands of incomplete raw scans using implicit representations. At test time, we jointly overfit two coordinate-based neural networks to the scene, one modeling the geometry and another estimating the surface radiance, using implicit differentiable rendering. We devise a two-stage optimization strategy in which the learned prior is used to initialize and constrain the geometry during an initial optimization phase. Then, the prior is unfrozen and fine-tuned to the scene. By doing this, we achieve high-fidelity head reconstructions, including hair and shoulders, and with a high level of detail that consistently outperforms both state-of-the-art 3D Morphable Models methods in the few-shot scenario, and non-parametric methods when large sets of views are available.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Ramon_H3D-Net_Few-Shot_High-Fidelity_3D_Head_Reconstruction_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

From the perspective of MLE, adopting different regression losses is making different assumptions about the output density function. A density function closer to the true distribution leads to a better regression performance.

Compared with black-box attack to image classification, there are two main challenges in black-box attack to detection. Firstly, even if one bounding-box is successfully attacked, another sub-optimal bounding-box may be detected near the attacked bounding-box.

Most of the previous work utilizing motion is deterministic but there are stochastic methods that can model the inherent uncertainty of the future. Existing stochastic models either do not reason about motion explicitly or make limiting assumptions about the static part. In this paper, we reason about appearance and motion in the video stochastically by predicting the future based on the motion history. Explicit reasoning about motion without history already reaches the performance of current stochastic models. The motion history further improves the results by allowing to predict consistent dynamics several frames into the future.

Learning To Diversify for Single Domain Generalization,"Zijian Wang, Yadan Luo, Ruihong Qiu, Zi Huang, Mahsa Baktashmotlagh"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 834-843","Domain generalization (DG) aims to generalize a model trained on multiple source (i.e., training) domains to a distributionally different target (i.e., test) domain. In contrast to the DG setup that strictly requires the availability of multiple source domains, this paper considers a more realistic yet challenging scenario, namely Single Domain Generalization (SDG). In this new setting, there is only one source domain available for training, from which the limited diversity may jeopardize the model generalization on unseen target domains. To tackle this problem, we propose a style-complement module to enhance the generalization power of the model by synthesizing images from diverse distributions that are complementary to the source ones. More specifically, we adopt tractable upper and lower bounds of mutual information (MI) between the generated and source samples and perform the two-step optimization iteratively: (1) by minimizing MI upper bound approximation for each pair, the generated images are forced to diversify from the source samples; (2) subsequently, we maximize the lower bound of MI between the samples from the same semantic category, which assists the network to learn discriminative features from diverse-styled images.

In this work, we propose a Wasserstein Coupled Graph Learning (WCGL) method to deal with the cross-modal retrieval task. First, graphs are constructed according to two input cross-modal samples separately, and passed through the corresponding graph encoders to extract robust features. Then, a Wasserstein coupled dictionary, containing multiple pairs of counterpart graph keys with each key corresponding to one modality, is constructed for further feature learning. Based on this dictionary, the input graphs can be transformed into the dictionary space to facilitate the similarity measurement through a Wasserstein Graph Embedding (WGE) process. The WGE could capture the graph correlation between the input and each corresponding key through optimal transport, and hence well characterize the inter-graph structural relationship. To further achieve discriminant graph learning, we specifically define a Wasserstein discriminant loss on the coupled graph keys to make the intra-class (counterpart) keys more compact and inter-class (non-counterpart) keys more dispersed, which further promotes the final cross-modal retrieval task.

In this paper, we investigate the error-bias issue in face alignment, where the distributions of landmark errors tend to spread along the tangent line to landmark curves. This error-bias is not trivial since it is closely connected to the ambiguous landmark labeling task. Inspired by this observation, we seek a way to leverage the error-bias property for better convergence of CNN model. To this end, we propose anisotropic direction loss (ADL) and anisotropic attention module (AAM) for coordinate and heatmap regression, respectively. ADL imposes strong binding force in normal direction for each landmark point on facial boundaries.

Although previous approaches pre-define the type of dataset bias to prevent the network from learning it, recognizing the bias type in the real dataset is often prohibitive. This paper proposes a novel bias-tailored augmentation-based approach, BiaSwap, for learning debiased representation without requiring supervision on the bias type. Motivated by the phenomenon that the bias corresponds to the attributes the model learns as a shortcut, we utilize an image-to-image translation model optimized to transfer the attributes that the classifier often learns easily. As a prerequisite, we sort the training samples based on how much a biased model exploits them as a shortcut and divide them into bias-guiding and bias-contrary samples in an unsupervised manner. Afterwards, we utilize the CAM of GCE-trained classifier in the patch cooccurrence discriminator in order to focus on translating the bias attributes. Therefore, given the pair of bias-guiding and bias-contrary, the model generates the augmented bias-swapped image which contains the bias attributes from the bias-contrary images, while preserving bias-irrelevant ones in the bias-guiding images. We demonstrate the superiority of our approach against the baselines over both synthetic and real-world datasets. Even without careful supervision on the bias, BiaSwap achieves a remarkable performance on both unbiased and bias-guiding samples, implying the improved generalization capability of the model.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Kim_BiaSwap_Removing_Dataset_Bias_With_Bias-Tailored_Swapping_Augmentation_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

It is hypothesized that the well known tendency of standard classifier training to overfit to popular classes can be exploited for effective transfer learning. Rather than eliminating this overfitting, e.g. by adopting popular class-balanced sampling methods, the learning algorithm should instead leverage this overfitting to transfer geometric information from popular to low-shot classes. A new classifier architecture, GistNet, is proposed to support this goal, using constellations of classifier parameters to encode the class geometry. A new learning algorithm is then proposed for GeometrIc Structure Transfer (GIST), with resort to a combination of loss functions that combine class-balanced and random sampling to guarantee that, while overfitting to the popular classes is restricted to geometric parameters, it is leveraged to transfer class geometry from popular to few-shot classes. This enables better generalization for few-shot classes without the need for the manual specification of class weights, or even the explicit grouping of classes into different types.

Distance-Aware Quantization,"Dohyung Kim, Junghyup Lee, Bumsub Ham"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 5271-5280","We address the problem of network quantization, that is, reducing bit-widths of weights and/or activations to lighten network architectures. Quantization methods use a rounding function to map full-precision values to the nearest quantized ones, but this operation is not differentiable. There are mainly two approaches to training quantized networks with gradient-based optimizers. First, a straight-through estimator (STE) replaces the zero derivative of the rounding with that of an identity function, which causes a gradient mismatch problem. Second, soft quantizers approximate the rounding with continuous functions at training time, and exploit the rounding for quantization at test time. This alleviates the gradient mismatch, but causes a quantizer gap problem. We alleviate both problems in a unified framework. To this end, we introduce a novel quantizer, dubbed a distance-aware quantizer (DAQ), that mainly consists of a distance-aware soft rounding (DASR) and a temperature controller. To alleviate the gradient mismatch problem, DASR approximates the discrete rounding with the kernel soft argmax, which is based on our insight that the quantization can be formulated as a distance-based assignment problem between full-precision values and quantized ones. The controller adjusts the temperature parameter in DASR adaptively according to the input, addressing the quantizer gap problem.

To date, neither of the reported issues have undergone thorough formal analysis. In our work, we contribute a comprehensive formal analysis of the shift equivariance properties of encoder-decoder-style CNNs, which yields a clear picture of what can and cannot be achieved with metric learning in the face of same-looking objects.

Furthermore, we show that to avoid discontinuities in a tile-and-stitch approach, assuming standard batch size 1, it is necessary to employ valid convolutions in combination with a training output window size strictly greater than f^l, while at test-time it is necessary to crop tiles to size n * f^l before stitching, with n >= 1.

Gupta, Cedric Nugteren"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 7057-7067","In semantic segmentation tasks, input images can often have more than one plausible interpretation, thus allowing for multiple valid labels. To capture such ambiguities, recent work has explored the use of probabilistic networks that can learn a distribution over predictions. However, these do not necessarily represent the empirical distribution accurately. In this work, we present a strategy for learning a calibrated predictive distribution over semantic maps, where the probability associated with each prediction reflects its ground truth correctness likelihood. To this end, we propose a novel two-stage, cascaded approach for calibrated adversarial refinement: (i) a standard segmentation network is trained with categorical cross-entropy to predict a pixelwise probability distribution over semantic classes and (ii) an adversarially trained stochastic network is used to model the inter-pixel correlations to refine the output of the first network into coherent samples. Importantly, to calibrate the refinement network and prevent mode collapse, the expectation of the samples in the second stage is matched to the probabilities predicted in the first. We demonstrate the versatility and robustness of the approach by achieving state-of-the-art results on the multigrader LIDC dataset and on a modified Cityscapes dataset with injected ambiguities.

To this end, we propose Neural Parametric Models (NPMs), a novel, learned alternative to traditional, parametric 3D models, which does not require hand-crafted, object-specific constraints.

Unlike existing neural network based optimization method that relies on estimated correspondences, our method directly optimizes over implicit volumes, eliminating the challenging step of matching pixels in indoor scenes. The key to our approach is to utilize the learning-based priors to guide the optimization process of NeRF. Our system firstly adapts a monocular depth network over the target scene by finetuning on its sparse SfM reconstruction. Then, we show that the shape-radiance ambiguity of NeRF still exists in indoor environments and propose to address the issue by employing the adapted depth priors to monitor the sampling process of volume rendering. Finally, a per-pixel confidence map acquired by error computation on the rendered image can be used to further improve the depth quality. Experiments show that our proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on indoor scenes, with surprising findings presented on the effectiveness of correspondence-based optimization and NeRF-based optimization over the adapted depth priors.

The exploitation of virtual classes not only utilizes augmented information for training but also alleviates a strong focus on seen classes for better generalization. Moreover, we embed the idea of curriculum learning by slowly adding virtual classes for a gradual increase in learning difficulty, which improves the learning stability as well as the final performance.

Despite progress on 3D scanning and modeling of human bodies, there is still no technology that can easily turn a static scan into an animatable avatar. Automating the creation of such avatars would enable many applications in games, social networking, animation, and AR/VR to name a few. The key problem is one of representation. Standard 3D meshes are widely used in modeling the minimally-clothed body but do not readily capture the complex topology of clothing. Recent interest has shifted to implicit surface models for this task but they are computationally heavy and lack compatibility with existing 3D tools. What is needed is a 3D representation that can capture varied topology at high resolution and that can be learned from data.

We validated our method on two different experimental setups, with different magnifications and sample types, to show a consistent improvement in performance as compared to conventional microscope imaging methods. Additionally, to understand the importance of learned illumination on the inference task, we varied the number of illumination patterns being optimized (and thus the number of unique images captured) and analyzed how the structure of the patterns changed as their number increased.

Dynamic Attentive Graph Learning for Image Restoration,"Chong Mou, Jian Zhang, Zhuoyuan Wu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 4328-4337","Non-local self-similarity in natural images has been verified to be an effective prior for image restoration. However, most existing deep non-local methods assign a fixed number of neighbors for each query item, neglecting the dynamics of non-local correlations. Moreover, the non-local correlations are usually based on pixels, prone to be biased due to image degradation. To rectify these weaknesses, in this paper, we propose a dynamic attentive graph learning model (DAGL) to explore the dynamic non-local property on patch level for image restoration. Specifically, we propose an improved graph model to perform patch-wise graph convolution with a dynamic and adaptive number of neighbors for each node. In this way, image content can adaptively balance over-smooth and over-sharp artifacts through the number of its connected neighbors, and the patch-wise non-local correlations can enhance the message passing process. Experimental results on various image restoration tasks: synthetic image denoising, real image denoising, image demosaicing, and compression artifact reduction show that our DAGL can produce state-of-the-art results with superior accuracy and visual quality.

Although the self-supervised pipeline has achieved great success in 2D domain, the characteristic challenges (e.g., complex geometry structure and various 3D object views) encountered in the 3D domain hinder the direct adoption of existing techniques that often contrast the 2D augmented data or cluster single-view features. Here we present a novel self-supervised 3D Object detection framework that seamlessly integrates the geometry-aware contrast and clustering harmonization to lift the unsupervised 3D representation learning, named GCC-3D. First, GCC-3D introduces a Geometric-Aware Contrastive objective to learn spatial-sensitive local structure representation. This objective enforces the spatially-closed voxels to have high feature similarity. Second, a Pseudo-Instance Clustering harmonization mechanism is proposed to encourage that different views of pseudo-instances should have consistent similarities to clustering prototype centers. This module endows our model semantic discriminative capacity.

To lower the cost of data annotation, active learning has been proposed to interactively query an oracle to annotate a small proportion of informative samples in an unlabeled dataset. Inspired by the fact that the samples with higher loss are usually more informative to the model than the samples with lower loss, in this paper we present a novel deep active learning approach that queries the oracle for data annotation when the unlabeled sample is believed to incorporate high loss. The core of our approach is a measurement Temporal Output Discrepancy (TOD) that estimates the sample loss by evaluating the discrepancy of outputs given by models at different optimization steps. Our theoretical investigation shows that TOD lower-bounds the accumulated sample loss thus it can be used to select informative unlabeled samples. On basis of TOD, we further develop an effective unlabeled data sampling strategy as well as an unsupervised learning criterion that enhances model performance by incorporating the unlabeled data. Due to the simplicity of TOD, our active learning approach is efficient, flexible, and task-agnostic.

To address this problem, we for the first time propose a novel K+1-way softmax formulation, which incorporates the modeling of open-world uncertainty as to the extra dimension. To unify the learning of the original K-way classification task and the extra dimension that models uncertainty, we (1)propose a novel energy-based objective function, and moreover, (2) theoretically prove that optimizing such an objective essentially forces the extra dimension to capture the marginal data distribution.

Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods search for architecture based on its performance on the training data, which may result in poor generalization for OoD tasks. In this work, we propose robust Neural Architecture Search for OoD generalization (NAS-OoD), which optimizes the architecture with respect to its performance on generated OoD data by gradient descent.

The data generator and the neural architecture are jointly optimized in an end-to-end manner, and the minimax training process effectively discovers robust architectures that generalize well for different distribution shifts. Extensive experimental results show that NAS-OoD achieves superior performance on various OoD generalization benchmarks with deep models having a much fewer number of parameters.

Most previous works of AUC maximization focus on the perspective of optimization by designing efficient stochastic algorithms, and studies on generalization performance of large-scale DAM on difficult tasks are missing. In this work, we aim to make DAM more practical for interesting real-world applications (e.g., medical image classification). First, we propose a new margin-based min-max surrogate loss function for the AUC score (named as the AUC min-max-margin loss or simply AUC margin loss for short). It is more robust than the commonly used AUC square loss, while enjoying the same advantage in terms of large-scale stochastic optimization. Second, we conduct extensive empirical studies of our DAM method on four difficult medical image classification tasks, namely (i) classification of chest x-ray images for identifying many threatening diseases, (ii) classification of images of skin lesions for identifying melanoma, (iii) classification of mammogram for breast cancer screening, and (iv) classification of microscopic images for identifying tumor tissue. Our studies demonstrate that the proposed DAM method improves the performance of optimizing cross-entropy loss by a large margin, and also achieves better performance than optimizing the existing AUC square loss on these medical image classification tasks. Specifically, our DAM method has achieved the 1st place on Stanford CheXpert competition on Aug. 31, 2020. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that makes DAM succeed on large-scale medical image datasets.

To answer these questions and systematically evaluate the global structure features, we focus on shape features and pro-pose two edge-enabled pipelines EdgeNetRob and Edge-GANRob, forcing the CNNs to rely more on edge features. Specifically, EdgeNetRob and EdgeGANRob first explicitly extract shape structure features from a given image via an edge detection algorithm. Then EdgeNetRob trains down-stream learning tasks directly on the extracted edge features, while EdgeGANRob reconstructs a new image by re-filling the texture information with a trained generative adversarial network (GANs). To reduce the sensitivity of edge detection algorithms to perturbations, we additionally propose a robust edge detection approach Robust Canny based on vanilla Canny.

EdgeGANRob, on the other hand, is able to improve the clean model accuracy compared to EdgeNetRob while preserving robustness.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for both detection and classification that explicitly incorporates spatial contextual information. We use the spatial statistical function to describe local density in both a multi-class and a multi-scale manner.

Learning by Aligning: Visible-Infrared Person Re-Identification Using Cross-Modal Correspondences,"Hyunjong Park, Sanghoon Lee, Junghyup Lee, Bumsub Ham"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 12046-12055","We address the problem of visible-infrared person re-identification (VI-reID), that is, retrieving a set of person images, captured by visible or infrared cameras, in a cross-modal setting. Two main challenges in VI-reID are intra-class variations across person images, and cross-modal discrepancies between visible and infrared images. Assuming that the person images are roughly aligned, previous approaches attempt to learn coarse image- or rigid part-level person representations that are discriminative and generalizable across different modalities. However, the person images, typically cropped by off-the-shelf object detectors, are not necessarily well-aligned, which distract discriminative person representation learning. In this paper, we introduce a novel feature learning framework that addresses these problems in a unified way. To this end, we propose to exploit dense correspondences between cross-modal person images. This allows to address the cross-modal discrepancies in a pixel-level, suppressing modality-related features from person representations more effectively. This also encourages pixel-wise associations between cross-modal local features, further facilitating discriminative feature learning for VI-reID. Extensive experiments and analyses on standard VI-reID benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, which significantly outperforms the state of the art.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Park_Learning_by_Aligning_Visible-Infrared_Person_Re-Identification_Using_Cross-Modal_Correspondences_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

Recent works attempt to generate binaural audio in a multimodal learning framework using large quantities of videos with accompanying binaural audio. In contrast, we attempt a more challenging problem -- synthesizing binaural audios for a video with monaural audio in a weakly supervised setting and weakly semi-supervised setting. Our key idea is that any down-stream task that can be solved only using binaural audios can be used to provide proxy supervision for binaural audio generation, thereby reducing the reliance on explicit supervision. In this work, as a proxy-task for weak supervision, we use Sound Source Localization with only audio. We design a two-stage architecture called Localize-to-Binauralize Network (L2BNet). The first stage of L2BNet is a Stereo Generation (SG) network employed to generate two-stream audio from monaural audio using visual frame information as guidance. In the second stage, an Audio Localization (AL) network is designed to use the synthesized two-stream audio to localize sound sources in visual frames. The entire network is trained end-to-end so that the AL network provides necessary supervision for the SG network. We experimentally show that our weakly-supervised framework generates two-stream audio containing binaural cues. Through user study, we further validate that our proposed approach generates binaural-quality audio using as little as 10% of explicit binaural supervision data for the SG network.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Rachavarapu_Localize_to_Binauralize_Audio_Spatialization_From_Visual_Sound_Source_Localization_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

However, there is a serious semantic misalignment between different images from a global perspective, making these works suffer from poor generation quality and diversity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel Local-Fusion Generative Adversarial Network (LoFGAN) for few-shot image generation. Instead of using these available images as a whole, we first randomly divide them into a base image and several reference images. Next, LoFGAN matches local representations between the base and reference images based on semantic similarities and replaces the local features with the closest related local features. In this way, LoFGAN can produce more realistic and diverse images at a more fine-grained level, and simultaneously enjoy the characteristic of semantic alignment. Furthermore, a local reconstruction loss is also proposed, which can provide better training stability and generation quality. We conduct extensive experiments on three datasets, which successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed method for few-shot image generation and downstream visual applications with limited data.

To address this, we introduce SPEC, the first in-the-wild 3D HPS method that estimates the perspective camera from a single image and employs this to reconstruct 3D human bodies more accurately. First, we train a neural network to estimate the field of view, camera pitch, and roll given an input image. We employ novel losses that improve the calibration accuracy over previous work. We then train a novel network that concatenates the camera calibration to the image features and uses these together to regress 3D body shape and pose. SPEC is more accurate than the prior art on the standard benchmark (3DPW) as well as two new datasets with more challenging camera views and varying focal lengths. Specifically, we create a new photorealistic synthetic dataset (SPEC-SYN) with ground truth 3D bodies and a novel in-the-wild dataset (SPEC-MTP) with calibration and high-quality reference bodies.

Binocular Mutual Learning for Improving Few-Shot Classification,"Ziqi Zhou, Xi Qiu, Jiangtao Xie, Jianan Wu, Chi Zhang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 8402-8411","Most of the few-shot learning methods learn to transfer knowledge from datasets with abundant labeled data (i.e., the base set). From the perspective of class space on base set, existing methods either focus on utilizing all classes under a global view by normal pretraining, or pay more attention to adopt an episodic manner to train meta-tasks within few classes in a local view. However, the interaction of the two views is rarely explored. As the two views capture complementary information, we naturally think of the compatibility of them for achieving further performance gains. Inspired by the mutual learning paradigm and binocular parallax, we propose a unified framework, namely Binocular Mutual Learning (BML), which achieves the compatibility of the global view and the local view through both intra-view and cross-view modeling. Concretely, the global view learns in the whole class space to capture rich inter-class relationships. Meanwhile, the local view learns in the local class space within each episode, focusing on matching positive pairs correctly. In addition, cross-view mutual interaction further promotes the collaborative learning and the implicit exploration of useful knowledge from each other. During meta-test, binocular embeddings are aggregated together to support decision-making, which greatly improve the accuracy of classification.

Thanks to the discrimination ability of orientation maps, masks can be recovered without the need for extra foreground segmentation. All instances that match with the same anchor size share a common orientation map. This special sharing strategy reduces the amortized memory utilization for mask predictions but without loss of mask granularity.

Various search methods have been proposed aiming to find the optimal architecture in the search space. One would expect the search results to improve when the search space grows larger since it would potentially contain more performant candidates. Surprisingly, we observe that enlarging search space is unbeneficial or even detrimental to existing NAS methods such as DARTS, ProxylessNAS, and SPOS. This counterintuitive phenomenon suggests that enabling existing methods to large search space regimes is non-trivial. However, this problem is less discussed in the literature. We present a Neural Search-space Evolution (NSE) scheme, the first neural architecture search scheme designed especially for large space neural architecture search problems. The necessity of a well-designed search space with constrained size is a tacit consent in existing methods, and our NSE aims at minimizing such necessity.

However, for ObjectGoal navigation (""""find a TV""""), this is an open question; one we tackle in this paper. The current best-known result on ObjectNav with general-purpose models is 6% success rate. First, we show that the key problem is overfitting. Large-scale training results in 94% success rate on training environments and only 8% in validation. We observe that this stems from agents memorizing environment layouts during training -- sidestepping the need for exploration and directly learning shortest paths to nearby goal objects. We show that this is a natural consequence of optimizing for the task metric (which in fact penalizes exploration), is enabled by powerful observation encoders, and is possible due to the finite set of training environment configurations. Informed by our findings, we introduce Treasure Hunt Data Augmentation (THDA) to address overfitting in ObjectNav.

However, these methods still have one major obstacle: manually designing a lightweight and high-efficiency network is challenging and time-consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel deblurring method, dubbed PyNAS (pyramid neural architecture search network), towards automatically designing hyper-parameters including the scales, patches, and standard cell operators. The proposed PyNAS adopts gradient-based search strategies and innovatively searches the hierarchy patch and scale scheme not limited to the cell searching. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical search strategy tailored for the multi-scale and multi-patch deblurring task. The strategy follows the principle that the first distinguishes between the top-level (pyramid-scales and pyramid-patches) and bottom-level variables (cell operators) and then searches multi-scale variables using the top-to-bottom principle.

Unfortunately, mapping the target-domain distribution to the source-domain unconditionally may distort the essential structural information of the target-domain data. To this end, we firstly propose to introduce a novel multi-anchor based active learning strategy to assist domain adaptation regarding the semantic segmentation task. By innovatively adopting multiple anchors instead of a single centroid, the source domain can be better characterized as a multimodal distribution, thus more representative and complimentary samples are selected from the target domain.

Inspired by a few pioneering work, we solve this problem by trying to predict the indices of pre-defined interval bins of counts instead of the count values themselves. However, an inappropriate interval setting might make the count error contributions from different intervals extremely imbalanced, leading to inferior counting performance. Therefore, we propose a novel count interval partition criterion called Uniform Error Partition (UEP), which always keeps the expected counting error contributions equal for all intervals to minimize the prediction risk. Then to mitigate the inevitably introduced discretization errors in the count quantization process, we propose another criterion called Mean Count Proxies (MCP). The MCP criterion selects the best count proxy for each interval to represent its count value during inference, making the overall expected discretization error of an image nearly negligible.

Self Supervision to Distillation for Long-Tailed Visual Recognition,"Tianhao Li, Limin Wang, Gangshan Wu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 630-639","Deep learning has achieved remarkable progress for visual recognition on large-scale balanced datasets but still performs poorly on real-world long-tailed data. Previous methods often adopt class re-balanced training strategies to effectively alleviate the imbalance issue, but might be a risk of over-fitting tail classes. The recent decoupling method overcomes over-fitting issues by using a multi-stage training scheme, yet, it is still incapable of capturing tail class information in the feature learning stage. In this paper, we show that soft label can serve as a powerful solution to incorporate label correlation into a multi-stage training scheme for long-tailed recognition. The intrinsic relation between classes embodied by soft labels turns out to be helpful for long-tailed recognition by transferring knowledge from head to tail classes. Specifically, we propose a conceptually simple yet particularly effective multi-stage training scheme, termed as Self Supervised to Distillation (SSD). This scheme is composed of two parts. First, we introduce a self-distillation framework for long-tailed recognition, which can mine the label relation automatically. Second, we present a new distillation label generation module guided by self-supervision. The distilled labels integrate information from both label and data domains that can model long-tailed distribution effectively. We conduct extensive experiments and our method achieves the state-of-the-art results on three long-tailed recognition benchmarks: ImageNet-LT, CIFAR100-LT and iNaturalist 2018.

Learning To Track With Object Permanence,"Pavel Tokmakov, Jie Li, Wolfram Burgard, Adrien Gaidon"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 10860-10869","Tracking by detection, the dominant approach for online multi-object tracking, alternates between localization and association steps. As a result, it strongly depends on the quality of instantaneous observations, often failing when objects are not fully visible. In contrast, tracking in humans is underlined by the notion of object permanence: once an object is recognized, we are aware of its physical existence and can approximately localize it even under full occlusions. In this work, we introduce an end-to-end trainable approach for joint object detection and tracking that is capable of such reasoning. We build on top of the recent CenterTrack architecture, which takes pairs of frames as input, and extend it to videos of arbitrary length. To this end, we augment the model with a spatio-temporal, recurrent memory module, allowing it to reason about object locations and identities in the current frame using all the previous history. It is, however, not obvious how to train such an approach. We study this question on a new, large-scale, synthetic dataset for multi-object tracking, which provides ground truth annotations for invisible objects, and propose several approaches for supervising tracking behind occlusions.

The core idea is to first learn a conditional distribution over the backbone's output to obtain initial estimates and associated uncertainties, and then reason over these uncertain regions with attention mechanism to produce final predictions. Our approach combines the benefits of both Bayesian learning and Transformer-based reasoning, allowing the model to handle camouflaged object detection by leveraging both deterministic and probabilistic information.

Current methods that treat source and target supervision without distinction overlook their inherent discrepancy, resulting in a source-dominated model that has not effectively use the target supervision. In this paper, we argue that the labeled target data needs to be distinguished for effective SSDA, and propose to explicitly decompose the SSDA task into two sub-tasks: a semi-supervised learning (SSL) task in the target domain and an unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) task across domains. By doing so, the two sub-tasks can better leverage the corresponding supervision and thus yield very different classifiers. To integrate the strengths of the two classifiers, we apply the well established co-training framework, in which the two classifiers exchange their high confident predictions to iteratively ""teach each other"" so that both classifiers can excel in the target domain. We call our approach Deep Co-training with Task decomposition (DeCoTa). DeCoTa requires no adversarial training and is easy to implement. Moreover, DeCoTa is well founded on the theoretical condition of when co-training would succeed. As a result, DeCoTa achieves state-of-the-art results on several SSDA datasets, outperforming the prior art by a notable 4% margin on DomainNet.

A challenge of training such a model lies in properly infusing class information into its generator and discriminator. For the discriminator, class conditioning can be achieved by either (1) directly incorporating labels as input or (2) involving labels in an auxiliary classification loss. In this paper, we show that the former directly aligns the class-conditioned fake-and-real data distributions P(\text image |\text class ) ( data matching ), while the latter aligns data-conditioned class distributions P(\text class |\text image ) ( label matching ). Although class separability does not directly translate to sample quality, the discriminator cannot provide useful guidance for the generator if features of distinct classes are mapped to the same point and thus become inseparable. Motivated by this intuition, we propose a Dual Projection GAN (P2GAN) model that learns to balance between data matching and label matching .

This leads us to propose a two-stage deep learning approach, called EventHPE. The first-stage, FlowNet, is trained by unsupervised learning to infer optical flow from events. Both events and optical flow are closely related to human body dynamics, which are fed as input to the ShapeNet in the second stage, to estimate 3D human shapes. To mitigate the discrepancy between image-based flow (optical flow) and shape-based flow (vertices movement of human body shape), a novel flow coherence loss is introduced by exploiting the fact that both flows are originated from the identical human motion.

This paper addresses the synchronization problem on multi-graphs, that are graphs with more than one edge connecting the same pair of nodes. The problem naturally arises when multiple measures are available to model the relationship between two vertices. This happens when different sensors measure the same quantity, or when the original graph is partitioned into sub-graphs that are solved independently. In this case, the relationships among sub-graphs give rise to multi-edges and the problem can be traced back to a multi-graph synchronization. The baseline solution reduces multi-graphs to simple ones by averaging their multi-edges, however this approach falls short because: i) averaging is well defined only for some groups and ii) the resulting estimator is less precise and accurate, as we prove empirically.

To alleviate these problems, we propose Spatio-Temporal Representation Factorization (STRF), a flexible new computational unit that can be used in conjunction with most existing 3D convolutional neural network architectures for re-ID. The key innovations of STRF over prior work include explicit pathways for learning discriminative temporal and spatial features, with each component further factorized to capture complementary person-specific appearance and motion information. Specifically, temporal factorization comprises two branches, one each for static features (e.g., the color of clothes) that do not change much over time, and dynamic features (e.g., walking patterns) that change over time. Further, spatial factorization also comprises two branches to learn both global (coarse segments) as well as local (finer segments) appearance features, with the local features particularly useful in cases of occlusion or spatial misalignment. These two factorization operations taken together result in a modular architecture for our parameter-wise light STRF unit that can be plugged in between any two 3D convolutional layers, resulting in an end-to-end learning framework.

A common problem is the need for manual clean-up after the MVS step, as 3D scans are typically affected by noise and outliers and contain hairy surface regions that need to be cleaned up by artists. Furthermore, mesh registration tends to fail for extreme facial expressions. Most learning-based methods use an underlying 3D morphable model (3DMM) to ensure robustness, but this limits the output accuracy for extreme facial expressions. In addition, the global bottleneck of regression architectures cannot produce meshes that tightly fit the ground truth surfaces. We propose ToFu, Topological consistent Face from multi-view, a geometry inference framework that can produce topologically consistent meshes across facial identities and expressions using a volumetric representation instead of an explicit underlying 3DMM. Our novel progressive mesh generation network embeds the topological structure of the face in a feature volume, sampled from geometry-aware local features. A coarse-to-fine architecture facilitates dense and accurate facial mesh predictions in a consistent mesh topology. ToFu further captures displacement maps for pore-level geometric details and facilitates high-quality rendering in the form of albedo and specular reflectance maps. These high-quality assets are readily usable by production studios for avatar creation, animation and physically-based skin rendering.

Specifically, we propose an Intermediate Domain Module (IDM) to generate intermediate domains' representations on-the-fly by mixing the source and target domains' hidden representations using two domain factors. Based on the ""shortest geodesic path"" definition, i.e., the intermediate domains along the shortest geodesic path between the two extreme domains can play a better bridging role, we propose two properties that these intermediate domains should satisfy. To ensure these two properties to better characterize appropriate intermediate domains, we enforce the bridge losses on intermediate domains' prediction space and feature space, and enforce a diversity loss on the two domain factors. The bridge losses aim at guiding the distribution of appropriate intermediate domains to keep the right distance to the source and target domains. The diversity loss serves as a regularization to prevent the generated intermediate domains from being over-fitting to either of the source and target domains.

Meanwhile, a visual-geometry refinement network (VG-Refine Net) is also designed to further enhance the selected tracking results by considering both target appearance and temporal geometry constraints, allowing inaccurate tracking results to be corrected. The combination of the above two networks provides a principled approach to ensure the quality of automatic video annotation. Experiments on large scale tracking benchmarks demonstrate that our method can deliver highly accurate bounding box annotations and significantly reduce human labor by 94.0%, yielding an effective means to further boost tracking performance with augmented training data.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Dai_Video_Annotation_for_Visual_Tracking_via_Selection_and_Refinement_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

Here we propose a unified framework based on Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), where we treat any arbitrary input as a masked motion series.

To further allow the flexibility of manipulating the motion style of the generated series, we design an Action-Adaptive Modulation (AAM) to propagate the given semantic guidance through the whole sequence.

Elaborative Rehearsal for Zero-Shot Action Recognition,"Shizhe Chen, Dong Huang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 13638-13647","The growing number of action classes has posed a new challenge for video understanding, making Zero-Shot Action Recognition (ZSAR) a thriving direction. The ZSAR task aims to recognize target (unseen) actions without training examples by leveraging semantic representations to bridge seen and unseen actions. However, due to the complexity and diversity of actions, it remains challenging to semantically represent action classes and transfer knowledge from seen data. In this work, we propose an ER-enhanced ZSAR model inspired by an effective human memory technique Elaborative Rehearsal (ER), which involves elaborating a new concept and relating it to known concepts. Specifically, we expand each action class as an Elaborative Description (ED) sentence, which is more discriminative than a class name and less costly than manual-defined attributes. Besides directly aligning class semantics with videos, we incorporate objects from the video as Elaborative Concepts (EC) to improve video semantics and generalization from seen actions to unseen actions. Our ER-enhanced ZSAR model achieves state-of-the-art results on three existing benchmarks.

Existing FFG methods aim to disentangle content and style either by extracting a universal representation style or extracting multiple component-wise style representations. However, previous methods either fail to capture diverse local styles or cannot be generalized to a character with unseen components, e.g., unseen language systems. To mitigate the issues, we propose a novel FFG method, named Multiple Localized Experts Few-shot Font Generation Network (MX-Font).

We propose the TransFER model which can learn rich relation-aware local representations. It mainly consists of three components: Multi-Attention Dropping (MAD), ViT-FER, and Multi-head Self-Attention Dropping (MSAD). First, local patches play an important role in distinguishing various expressions, however, few existing works can locate discriminative and diverse local patches. This can cause serious problems when some patches are invisible due to pose variations or viewpoint changes. To address this issue, the MAD is proposed to randomly drop an attention map. Consequently, models are pushed to explore diverse local patches adaptively. Second, to build rich relations between different local patches, the Vision Transformers (ViT) are used in FER, called ViT-FER. Since the global scope is used to reinforce each local patch, a better representation is obtained to boost the FER performance. Thirdly, the multi-head self-attention allows ViT to jointly attend to features from different information subspaces at different positions. Given no explicit guidance, however, multiple self-attentions may extract similar relations. To address this, the MSAD is proposed to randomly drop one self-attention module. As a result, models are forced to learn rich relations among diverse local patches.

DNNs are shown to be vulnerable against the Trojan attack that manipulates the model parameters via poisoned training and gets activated by the pre-defined trigger in inputs during inference. In this work, we present ProFlip, the first targeted Trojan attack framework that can divert the prediction of the DNN to the target class by progressively identifying and flipping a small set of bits in model parameters. At its core, ProFlip consists of three key phases: (i) Determining significant neurons in the last layer; (ii) Generating an effective trigger pattern for the target class; (iii) Identifying a sequence of susceptible bits of DNN parameters stored in the main memory (e.g., DRAM). After model deployment, the adversary can insert the Trojan by flipping the critical bits found by ProFlip using bit flip techniques such as Row Hammer or laser beams. As the result, the altered DNN predicts the target class when the trigger pattern is present in any inputs. We perform extensive evaluations of ProFlip on CIFAR10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets with ResNet-18 and VGG-16 architectures. Empirical results show that, to reach an attack success rate (ASR) of over 94%, ProFlip requires only 12 bit flips out of 88 million parameter bits for ResNet-18 with CIFAR-10, and 15 bit flips for ResNet-18 with ImageNet. Compared to the SOTA, ProFlip reduces the number of required bits flips by 28x 34x while reaching the same level of ASR.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Chen_ProFlip_Targeted_Trojan_Attack_With_Progressive_Bit_Flips_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

In this work, we propose a new one-shot architecture search framework, namely AutoFormer, dedicated to vision transformer search. AutoFormer entangles the weights of different blocks in the same layers during supernet training. Benefiting from the strategy, the trained supernet allows thousands of subnets to be very well-trained. Specifically, the performance of these subnets with weights inherited from the supernet is comparable to those retrained from scratch. Besides, the searched models, which we refer to AutoFormers, surpass the recent state-of-the-arts such as ViT and DeiT.

In such a situation, one can derive an effective highlight detector on target video category by transferring the highlight knowledge acquired from source video category to the target one.

Towards an efficient multimodal fusion from asynchronous multimodal streams, we need to model the correlations between elements from different modalities. The recent Multimodal Transformer (MulT) approach extends the self-attention mechanism of the original Transformer network to learn the crossmodal dependencies between elements.

The existing action detection benchmarks are limited in aspects of small numbers of instances in a trimmed video or low-level atomic actions. This paper aims to present a new multi-person dataset of spatio-temporal localized sports actions, coined as MultiSports. We first analyze the important ingredients of constructing a realistic and challenging dataset for spatio-temporal action detection by proposing three criteria: (1) multi-person scenes and motion dependent identification, (2) with well-defined boundaries, (3) relatively fine-grained classes of high complexity. Based on these guidelines, we build the dataset of MultiSports v1.0 by selecting 4 sports classes, collecting 3200 video clips, and annotating 37701 action instances with 902k bounding boxes. Our datasets are characterized with important properties of high diversity, dense annotation, and high quality. Our MultiSports, with its realistic setting and detailed annotations, exposes the intrinsic challenges of spatio-temporal action detection. To benchmark this, we adapt several baseline methods to our dataset and give an in-depth analysis on the action detection results in our dataset.

Solving this task for composite scenes (such as object stacks) is challenging: occluded areas are not only ambiguous in shape but also in instance segmentation; multiple decompositions could be valid. We observe that physics constrains decomposition as well as shape in occluded regions and hypothesise that a latent space learned from scenes built under physics simulation can serve as a prior to better predict shape and instances in occluded regions. To this end we propose SIMstack, a depth-conditioned Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE), trained on a dataset of objects stacked under physics simulation. We formulate instance segmentation as a center voting task which allows for class-agnostic detection and doesn't require setting the maximum number of objects in the scene. At test time, our model can generate 3D shape and instance segmentation from a single depth view, probabilistically sampling proposals for the occluded region from the learned latent space.

Large-scale labeled training data is often difficult to collect, especially for person identities. A natural question is whether a good person search model can be trained without the need of identity supervision. In this paper, we present a weakly supervised setting where only bounding box annotations are available. Based on this new setting, we provide an effective baseline model termed Region Siamese Networks (R-SiamNets). Towards learning useful representations for recognition in the absence of identity labels, we supervise the R-SiamNet with instance-level consistency loss and cluster-level contrastive loss. For instance-level consistency learning, the R-SiamNet is constrained to extract consistent features from each person region with or without out-of-region context. For cluster-level contrastive learning, we enforce the aggregation of closest instances and the separation of dissimilar ones in feature space. Extensive experiments validate the utility of our weakly supervised method.

To solve this problem, we propose a network that treats a perspective image as input and predicts a spherical probability map of VP. Based on this map, we can detect all the VPs. Our method is reliable thanks to four technical novelties. First, we leverage the icosahedral spherical representation to express our probability map. This representation provides uniform pixel distribution, and thus facilitates estimating arbitrary positions of VPs. Second, we design a loss function that enforces the antipodal symmetry and sparsity of our spherical probability map to prevent over-fitting. Third, we generate the ground truth probability map that reasonably expresses the locations and uncertainties of VPs. This map unnecessarily peaks at noisy annotated VPs, and also exhibits various anisotropic dispersions. Fourth, given a predicted probability map, we detect VPs by fitting a Bingham mixture model. This strategy can robustly handle close VPs and provide the confidence level of VP useful for practical applications.

However, the formulation of efficient and high-performance learning algorithms for SNNs is still challenging. Most existing learning methods learn weights only, and require manual tuning of the membrane-related parameters that determine the dynamics of a single spiking neuron. These parameters are typically chosen to be the same for all neurons, which limits the diversity of neurons and thus the expressiveness of the resulting SNNs. In this paper, we take inspiration from the observation that membrane-related parameters are different across brain regions, and propose a training algorithm that is capable of learning not only the synaptic weights but also the membrane time constants of SNNs. We show that incorporating learnable membrane time constants can make the network less sensitive to initial values and can speed up learning. In addition, we reevaluate the pooling methods in SNNs and find that max-pooling will not lead to significant information loss and have the advantage of low computation cost and binary compatibility. We evaluate the proposed method for image classification tasks on both traditional static MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 datasets, and neuromorphic N-MNIST, CIFAR10-DVS, DVS128 Gesture datasets.

Our approach is able to sequentially find a series of VPs by repeatedly removing inliers of any detected VPs from minimal sample sets until the stop criterion is reached. Compared to traditional RANSAC that selects 2 edges as a hypothetical inlier pair to fit a model of VP hypothesis and requires hitting a pair of inliners, the UPRANSAC has a higher likelihood to hit one inliner and is more reliable in VP detection. Meanwhile, the tremendously scaled-down voting space with the requirement of only 1 parameter for processing significantly increased the performance efficiency of Hough Transform in our scheme.

Pose Invariant Topological Memory for Visual Navigation,"Asuto Taniguchi, Fumihiro Sasaki, Ryota Yamashina"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 15384-15393","Planning for visual navigation using topological memory, a memory graph consisting of nodes and edges, has been recently well-studied. The nodes correspond to past observations of a robot, and the edges represent the reachability predicted by a neural network (NN). Most prior methods, however, often fail to predict the reachability when the robot takes different poses, i.e. the direction the robot faces, at close positions. This is because the methods observe first-person view images, which significantly changes when the robot changes its pose, and thus it is fundamentally difficult to correctly predict the reachability from them. In this paper, we propose pose invariant topological memory (POINT) to address the problem. POINT observes omnidirectional images and predicts the reachability by using a spherical convolutional NN, which has a rotation invariance property and enables planning regardless of the robot's pose. Additionally, we train the NN by contrastive learning with data augmentation to enable POINT to plan with robustness to changes in environmental conditions, such as light conditions and the presence of unseen objects. Our experimental results show that POINT outperforms conventional methods under both the same and different environmental conditions.

To learn strong shape representations in an unsupervised manner, we first design a shape-disorganizing module to destroy certain local shape parts of an object. Then the destroyed shape and the normal shape are sent into a point cloud network to get representations, which are employed to segment points that belong to distorted parts and further reconstruct them to restore the shape to normal. To perform better in these two associated pretext tasks, the network is constrained to capture useful shape features from the object, which indicates that the point cloud network encodes rich geometric and contextual information. The learned feature extractor transfers well to downstream classification and segmentation tasks.

Existing approaches use images of unexpected objects from external datasets or require additional training (e.g., retraining segmentation networks or training an extra network), which necessitate a non-trivial amount of labor intensity or lengthy inference time. One possible alternative is to use prediction scores of a pre-trained network such as the max logits (i.e., maximum values among classes before the final softmax layer) for detecting such objects. However, the distribution of max logits of each predicted class is significantly different from each other, which degrades the performance of identifying unexpected objects in urban-scene segmentation.

In terms of ground truth, we propose an algorithm to automatically transfer Localized Narratives annotations to specific regions in the panoptic segmentations of the MS COCO dataset. To guarantee the quality of our annotations, we take advantage of the semantic structure contained in WordNet to exclusively incorporate noun phrases that are grounded to a meaningfully related panoptic segmentation region.

Weakly-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection With Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude Learning,"Yu Tian, Guansong Pang, Yuanhong Chen, Rajvinder Singh, Johan W.

Although current methods show effective detection performance, their recognition of the positive instances, i.e., rare abnormal snippets in the abnormal videos, is largely biased by the dominant negative instances, especially when the abnormal events are subtle anomalies that exhibit only small differences compared with normal events. This issue is exacerbated in many methods that ignore important video temporal dependencies. To address this issue, we introduce a novel and theoretically sound method, named Robust Temporal Feature Magnitude learning (RTFM), which trains a feature magnitude learning function to effectively recognise the positive instances, substantially improving the robustness of the MIL approach to the negative instances from abnormal videos. RTFM also adapts dilated convolutions and self-attention mechanisms to capture long- and short-range temporal dependencies to learn the feature magnitude more faithfully. Extensive experiments show that the RTFM-enabled MIL model (i) outperforms several state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on four benchmark data sets (ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime, XD-Violence and UCSD-Peds) and (ii) achieves significantly improved subtle anomaly discriminability and sample efficiency.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Tian_Weakly-Supervised_Video_Anomaly_Detection_With_Robust_Temporal_Feature_Magnitude_Learning_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Learning an Augmented RGB Representation With Cross-Modal Knowledge Distillation for Action Detection,"Rui Dai, Srijan Das, François Bremond"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 13053-13064","In video understanding, most cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) methods are tailored for classification tasks, focusing on the discriminative representation of the trimmed videos. However, action detection requires not only categorizing actions, but also localizing them in untrimmed videos. Therefore, transferring knowledge pertaining to temporal relations is critical for this task which is missing in the previous cross-modal KD frameworks. To this end, we aim at learning an augmented RGB representation for action detection, taking advantage of additional modalities at training time through KD. We propose a KD framework consisting of two levels of distillation. On one hand, atomic-level distillation encourages the RGB student to learn the sub-representation of the actions from the teacher in a contrastive manner. On the other hand, sequence-level distillation encourages the student to learn the temporal knowledge from the teacher, which consists of transferring the Global Contextual Relations and the action Boundary Saliency. The result is an Augmented-RGB stream that can achieve competitive performance as the two-stream network while using only RGB at inference time. Extensive experimental analysis shows that our proposed distillation framework is generic and outperforms other popular cross-modal distillation methods in the action detection task.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Dai_Learning_an_Augmented_RGB_Representation_With_Cross-Modal_Knowledge_Distillation_for_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

Cluster-Promoting Quantization With Bit-Drop for Minimizing Network Quantization Loss,"Jung Hyun Lee, Jihun Yun, Sung Ju Hwang, Eunho Yang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 5370-5379","Network quantization, which aims to reduce the bit-lengths of the network weights and activations, has emerged for their deployments to resource-limited devices. Although recent studies have successfully discretized a full-precision network, they still incur large quantization errors after training, thus giving rise to a significant performance gap between a full-precision network and its quantized counterpart. In this work, we propose a novel quantization method for neural networks, Cluster-Promoting Quantization (CPQ) that finds the optimal quantization grids while naturally encouraging the underlying full-precision weights to gather around those quantization grids cohesively during training. This property of CPQ is thanks to our two main ingredients that enable differentiable quantization: i) the use of the categorical distribution designed by a specific probabilistic parametrization in the forward pass and ii) our proposed multi-class straight-through estimator (STE) in the backward pass. Since our second component, multi-class STE, is intrinsically biased, we additionally propose a new bit-drop technique, DropBits, that revises the standard dropout regularization to randomly drop bits instead of neurons. As a natural extension of DropBits, we further introduce the way of learning heterogeneous quantization levels to find proper bit-length for each layer by imposing an additional regularization on DropBits. We experimentally validate our method on various benchmark datasets and network architectures, and also support a new hypothesis for quantization: learning heterogeneous quantization levels outperforms the case using the same but fixed quantization levels from scratch.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Lee_Cluster-Promoting_Quantization_With_Bit-Drop_for_Minimizing_Network_Quantization_Loss_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

As a first, we introduce a system addressing both problems, where prototypes evolve continually in a shared latent space, enabling learning and prediction at any point in time. To facilitate learning, a novel objective function synchronizes the latent space with the continually evolving prototypes.

While the mainstream technique seeks to completely filter out the OOD samples for semi-supervised learning (SSL), we propose a novel training mechanism that could effectively exploit the presence of OOD data for enhanced feature learning while avoiding its adverse impact on the SSL. We achieve this goal by first introducing a warm-up training that leverages all the unlabeled data, including both the in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. Specifically, we perform a pretext task that enforces our feature extractor to obtain a high-level semantic understanding of the training images, leading to more discriminative features that can benefit the downstream tasks.

Instead of directly applying binary classification, we train the network to predict whether the data sample is matched to an assigned one-hot class label. The appeal of the proposed cross-modal matching over binary classification is the ability to generate a compatible feature space that aligns with the core classification task.

Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) occluded ReID models rely on some auxiliary modules, including pose estimation, feature pyramid and graph matching modules, to learn multi-scale and/or part-level features to tackle the occlusion challenges. This unfortunately leads to complex ReID models that (i) fail to generalize to challenging occlusions of diverse appearance, shape or size, and (ii) become ineffective in handling non-occluded pedestrians.

Moreover, these two tasks are challenging due to large misalignment and occlusions, thus most of these methods are prone to generate unclear human body structure and blurry fine-grained textures. In this paper, we devise a structure-transformed texture-enhanced network to generate high-quality person images and construct the relationships between two tasks. It consists of two modules: structure-transformed renderer and texture-enhanced stylizer. The structure-transformed renderer is introduced to transform the source person structure to the target one, while the texture-enhanced stylizer is served to enhance detailed textures and controllably inject the fashion style founded on the structural transformation. With the two modules, our model can generate photorealistic person images in diverse poses and even with various fashion styles. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on two tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Xu_Structure-Transformed_Texture-Enhanced_Network_for_Person_Image_Synthesis_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
RMSMP: A Novel Deep Neural Network Quantization Framework With Row-Wise Mixed Schemes and Multiple Precisions,"Sung-En Chang, Yanyu Li, Mengshu Sun, Weiwen Jiang, Sijia Liu, Yanzhi Wang, Xue Lin"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 5251-5260","This work proposes a novel Deep Neural Network (DNN) quantization framework, namely RMSMP, with a \underline R ow-wise \underline M ixed-\underline S cheme and \underline M ulti-\underline P recision approach. Specifically, this is the first effort to assign mixed quantization schemes and multiple precisions within layers -- among rows of the DNN weight matrix, for simplified operations in hardware inference, while preserving accuracy. Furthermore, this paper makes a different observation from the prior work that the quantization error does not necessarily exhibit the layer-wise sensitivity, and actually can be mitigated as long as a certain portion of the weights in every layer are in higher precisions. This observation enables layer-wise uniformality in the hardware implementation towards guaranteed inference acceleration, while still enjoying row-wise flexibility of mixed schemes and multiple precisions to boost accuracy. The candidates of schemes and precisions are derived practically and effectively with a highly hardware-informative strategy to reduce the problem search space. With the offline determined ratio of different quantization schemes and precisions for all the layers, the RMSMP quantization algorithm uses Hessian and variance based method to effectively assign schemes and precisions for each row. The proposed RMSMP is tested for the image classification and natural language processing (BERT) applications, and achieves the best accuracy performance among state-of-the-arts under the same equivalent precisions. The RMSMP is implemented on FPGA devices, achieving 3.65xspeedup in the end-to-end inference time for ResNet-18 on ImageNet, comparing with the 4-bit Fixed-point baseline.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Chang_RMSMP_A_Novel_Deep_Neural_Network_Quantization_Framework_With_Row-Wise_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

To address this issue, we propose a generic motion forecasting framework (named RAIN) with dynamic key information selection and ranking based on a hybrid attention mechanism. The general framework is instantiated to handle multi-agent trajectory prediction and human motion forecasting tasks, respectively. In the former task, the model learns to recognize the relations between agents with a graph representation and to determine their relative significance.

Nevertheless, prior model quantization either suffers from the inefficient data encoding method thus leading to noncompetitive model compression rate, or requires time-consuming quantization aware training process.

We argue that exploring the weaknesses of the detector so as to remedy them is a promising method of robust facial landmark detection. To achieve this, we propose a sample-adaptive adversarial training (SAAT) approach to interactively optimize an attacker and a detector, which improves facial landmark detection as a defense against sample-adaptive black-box attacks. By leveraging adversarial attacks, the proposed SAAT exploits adversarial perturbations beyond the handcrafted transformations to improve the detector. Specifically, an attacker generates adversarial perturbations to reflect the weakness of the detector. Then, the detector must improve its robustness to adversarial perturbations to defend against adversarial attacks. Moreover, a sample-adaptive weight is designed to balance the risks and benefits of augmenting adversarial examples to train the detector.

Disentangled Lifespan Face Synthesis,"Sen He, Wentong Liao, Michael Ying Yang, Yi-Zhe Song, Bodo Rosenhahn, Tao Xiang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 3877-3886","A lifespan face synthesis (LFS) model aims to generate a set of photo-realistic face images of a person's whole life, given only one snapshot as reference. The generated face image given a target age code is expected to be age-sensitive reflected by bio-plausible transformations of shape and texture, while being identity preserving. This is extremely challenging because the shape and texture characteristics of a face undergo separate and highly nonlinear transformations w.r.t. age. Most recent LFS models are based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) whereby age code conditional transformations are applied to a latent face representation. They benefit greatly from the recent advancements of GANs. However, without explicitly disentangling their latent representations into the texture, shape and identity factors, they are fundamentally limited in modeling the nonlinear age-related transformation on texture and shape whilst preserving identity. In this work, a novel LFS model is proposed to disentangle the key face characteristics including shape, texture and identity so that the unique shape and texture age transformations can be modeled effectively. This is achieved by extracting shape, texture and identity features separately from an encoder. Critically, two transformation modules, one conditional convolution based and the other channel attention based, are designed for modeling the nonlinear shape and texture feature transformations respectively. This is to accommodate their rather distinct aging processes and ensure that our synthesized images are both age-sensitive and identity preserving.

It has been shown that events alone can be used for end-task learning, e.g., semantic segmentation, based on encoder-decoder-like networks. However, as events are sparse and mostly reflect edge information, it is difficult to recover original details merely relying on the decoder. Moreover, most methods resort to the pixel-wise loss alone for supervision, which might be insufficient to fully exploit the visual details from sparse events, thus leading to less optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a simple yet flexible two-stream framework named Dual Transfer Learning (DTL) to effectively enhance the performance on the end-tasks without adding extra inference cost. The proposed approach consists of three parts: event to end-task learning (EEL) branch, event to image translation (EIT) branch, and transfer learning (TL) module that simultaneously explores the feature-level affinity information and pixel-level knowledge from the EIT branch to improve the EEL branch. This simple yet novel method leads to strong representation learning from events and is evidenced by the significant performance boost on the end-tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Wang_Dual_Transfer_Learning_for_Event-Based_End-Task_Prediction_via_Pluggable_Event_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv

However, the model deployment is usually subject to some computational resources. Model pruning under computational budget has attracted growing attention. In this paper, we focus on the discrimination-aware compression of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In prior arts, directly searching the optimal sub-network is an integer programming problem, which is non-smooth, non-convex, and NP-hard. Meanwhile, the heuristic pruning criterion lacks clear interpretability and doesn't generalize well in applications. To address this problem, we formulate sub-networks as samples from a multivariate Bernoulli distribution and resort to the approximation of continuous problem. We propose a new flexible search scheme via alternating exploration and estimation. In the exploration step, we employ stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with budget-awareness to generate sub-networks, which allows large search space with efficient computation. In the estimation step, we deduce the sub-network sampler to a near-optimal point, to promote the generation of high-quality sub-networks. Unifying the exploration and estimation, our approach avoids early falling into local minimum via a fast gradient-based search in a larger space.

We propose a novel compositional learning framework that decouples interaction labels into separate action and object scores that incorporate the spatial compatibility between the two components. We combine these scores to efficiently recognize seen and unseen interactions. However, learning action-object spatial relations, in principle, requires bounding-box annotations, which are costly to gather. Moreover, it is not clear how to generalize spatial relations to unseen interactions. We address these challenges by developing a cross-attention mechanism that localizes objects from action locations and vice versa by predicting displacements between them, referred to as relational directions. During training, we estimate the relational directions as ones maximizing the scores of ground-truth interactions that guide predictions toward compatible action-object regions. By extensive experiments, we show the effectiveness of our framework, where we improve the state of the art by 2.6% mAP score and 5.8% recall score on HICO and Visual Genome datasets, respectively.

To mitigate this problem, we take inspirations from the field of structure-from-motion (SfM), where many pipelines have matured in reconstructing a 3D scene from multiple images. Motivated by the success of the incremental approach in robust SfM, we present an efficient reassembly method for axially symmetric pots based on iterative registration of one sherd at a time.

Our main contribution is the introduction of a novel loss formulation, which jointly enhances the discriminability of latent embeddings and robustness of the output temporal class activations with respect to foreground-background noise caused by weak supervision. The proposed formulation comprises a discriminative and a denoising loss term for enhancing temporal action localization. The discriminative term incorporates a classification loss and utilizes a top-down attention mechanism to enhance the separability of latent foreground-background embeddings. The denoising loss term explicitly addresses the foreground-background noise in class activations by simultaneously maximizing intra-video and inter-video mutual information using a bottom-up attention mechanism.

Adaptive Surface Reconstruction With Multiscale Convolutional Kernels,"Benjamin Ummenhofer, Vladlen Koltun"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 5651-5660","We propose generalized convolutional kernels for 3D reconstruction with ConvNets from point clouds. Our method uses multiscale convolutional kernels that can be applied to adaptive grids as generated with octrees. In addition to standard kernels in which each element has a distinct spatial location relative to the center, our elements have a distinct relative location as well as a relative scale level. Making our kernels span multiple resolutions allows us to apply ConvNets to adaptive grids for large problem sizes where the input data is sparse but the entire domain needs to be processed. Our ConvNet architecture can predict the signed and unsigned distance fields for large data sets with millions of input points and is faster and more accurate than classic energy minimization or recent learning approaches.

Despite achieving significant improvement in a variety of applications, we find out that SimpleMKKM could indiscriminately force all sample pairs to be equally aligned with the same ideal similarity. As a result, it does not sufficiently take the variation of samples into consideration, leading to unsatisfying clustering performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel MKC algorithm with a ""local"" kernel alignment, which only requires that the similarity of a sample to its k-nearest neighbours be aligned with the ideal similarity matrix. Such an alignment helps the clustering algorithm to focus on closer sample pairs that shall stay together and avoids involving unreliable similarity evaluation for farther sample pairs. After that, we theoretically show that the objective of SimpleMKKM is a special case of this local kernel alignment criterion with normalizing each base kernel matrix. Based on this observation, the proposed localized SimpleMKKM can be readily implemented by existing SimpleMKKM package. Moreover, we conduct extensive experiments on several widely used benchmark datasets to evaluate the clustering performance of localized SimpleMKKM. The experimental results have demonstrated that our algorithm consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ones, verifying the effectiveness of the proposed local kernel alignment criterion.

We extend neural radiance fields (NeRF) to jointly encode semantics with appearance and geometry, so that complete and accurate 2D semantic labels can be achieved using a small amount of in-place annotations specific to the scene. The intrinsic multi-view consistency and smoothness of NeRF benefit semantics by enabling sparse labels to efficiently propagate. We show the benefit of this approach when labels are either sparse or very noisy in room-scale scenes.

Previous works have proposed to model each base class either with a single point or with a mixture model by relying on offline clustering algorithms. In contrast, we propose to model base classes with mixture models by simultaneously training the feature extractor and learning the mixture model parameters in an online manner. This results in a richer and more discriminative feature space which can be employed to classify novel examples from very few samples. Two main stages are proposed to train the MixtFSL model. First, the multimodal mixtures for each base class and the feature extractor parameters are learned using a combination of two loss functions. Second, the resulting network and mixture models are progressively refined through a leader-follower learning procedure, which uses the current estimate as a ""target"" network. This target network is used to make a consistent assignment of instances to mixture components, which increases performance and stabilizes training. The effectiveness of our end-to-end feature space learning approach is demonstrated with extensive experiments on four standard datasets and four backbones.

F-Drop&Match: GANs With a Dead Zone in the High-Frequency Domain,"Shin'ya Yamaguchi, Sekitoshi Kanai"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 6743-6751","Generative adversarial networks built from deep convolutional neural networks (GANs) lack the ability to exactly replicate the high-frequency components of natural images. To alleviate this issue, we introduce two novel training techniques called frequency dropping (F-Drop) and frequency matching (F-Match). The key idea of F-Drop is to filter out unnecessary high-frequency components from the input images of the discriminators. This simple modification prevents the discriminators from being confused by perturbations of the high-frequency components. In addition, F-Drop makes the GANs focus on fitting in the low-frequency domain, in which there are the dominant components of natural images. F-Match minimizes the difference between real and fake images in the frequency domain for generating more realistic images.

While the standard homogeneous reconstruction task aims to recover a single static structure, recently-proposed neural and non-neural methods can reconstruct distributions of structures, thereby enabling the study of protein complexes that possess intrinsic structural or conformational heterogeneity. These heterogeneous reconstruction methods, however, require fixed image poses, which are typically estimated from an upstream homogeneous reconstruction and are not guaranteed to be accurate under highly heterogeneous conditions. In this work we describe cryoDRGN2, an ab initio reconstruction algorithm, which can jointly estimate image poses and learn a neural model of a distribution of 3D structures on real heterogeneous cryo-EM data. To achieve this, we adapt search algorithms from the traditional cryo-EM literature, and describe the optimizations and design choices required to make such a search procedure computationally tractable in the neural model setting.

To achieve this, we introduce a two-step framework that adopts a predetermined mid-level prior in a contrastive optimization objective to learn pixel embeddings. This marks a large deviation from existing works that relied on proxy tasks or end-to-end clustering. Additionally, we argue about the importance of having a prior that contains information about objects, or their parts, and discuss several possibilities to obtain such a prior in an unsupervised manner. Experimental evaluation shows that our method comes with key advantages over existing works. First, the learned pixel embeddings can be directly clustered in semantic groups using K-Means on PASCAL.

Different from basic contrastive clustering that only assumes an image and its augmentation should share similar representation and clustering assignments, we lift the instance-level consistency to the cluster-level consistency with the assumption that samples in one cluster and their augmentations should all be similar.

In practice, our model first predicts the target category from the language descriptions using a simple language classification model. Then based on the category, our model sifts out a small number of instance candidates (usually less than 20) from the panoptic segmentation on point clouds. Thus, the non-trivial 3D visual grounding task has been effectively re-formulated as a simplified instance-matching problem, considering that instance-level candidates are more rational than the redundant 3D object proposals.

Specifically, this paper aims to learn a domain-shared representation of semantic categories, via two novel self-supervised geometric learning tasks as feature regularization. On one hand, the representation learning is empowered by a linear mixup of point cloud samples with their self-generated rotation labels, to capture a global topological configuration of local geometries.

Several defenses have been proposed to improve the robustness against these variations. However, current defenses can only withstand the specific attack used in training, and the models often remain vulnerable to other input variations. Moreover, these methods often degrade performance of the model on clean images. In this paper, we present Generative Adversarial Training, an approach to simultaneously improve the model's generalization and robustness to unseen adversarial attacks. Instead of altering a single pre-defined aspect of images, we generate a spectrum of low-level, mid-level and high-level changes using generative models with a disentangled latent space. Adversarial training with these examples enable the model to withstand a wide range of attacks by observing a variety of input alterations during training. We show that our approach not only improves performance of the model on clean images but also makes it robust against unforeseen attacks and outperforms prior work.

To solve the issue, we propose the novel Inter-Channel Correlation for Knowledge Distillation (ICKD), with which the diversity and homology of the feature space of the student network can align with that of the teacher network. The correlation between these two channels is interpreted as diversity if they are irrelevant to each other, otherwise homology.

Several recent works attribute this to over-fitting to minor classes. In this paper, we provide a novel explanation of this issue. We found that a neural network tends to first under-fit the minor classes by classifying most of their data into the major classes in early training epochs. To correct these wrong predictions, the neural network then must focus on pushing features of minor class data across the decision boundaries between major and minor classes, leading to much larger gradients for features of minor classes. We argue that such an under-fitting phase over-emphasizes the competition between major and minor classes, hinders the neural network from learning the discriminative knowledge that can be generalized to test data, and eventually results in over-fitting. To address this issue, we propose a novel learning strategy to equalize the training progress across classes. We mix features of the major class data with those of other data in a mini-batch, intentionally weakening their features to prevent a neural network from fitting them first. We show that this strategy can largely balance the training accuracy and feature gradients across classes, effectively mitigating the under-fitting then over-fitting problem for minor class data.

Recent papers have ported these methods from still images to videos and found that leveraging both audio and video signals yields strong gains; however, they did not find that spatial augmentations such as cropping, which are very important for still images, work as well for videos. In this paper, we improve these formulations in two ways unique to the spatio-temporal aspect of videos.

This paper presents RDA, a robust domain adaptation technique that introduces adversarial attacking to mitigate overfitting in UDA. We achieve robust domain adaptation by a novel Fourier adversarial attacking (FAA) method that allows large magnitude of perturbation noises but has minimal modification of image semantics, the former is critical to the effectiveness of its generated adversarial samples due to the existence of domain gaps. Specifically, FAA decomposes images into multiple frequency components (FCs) and generates adversarial samples by just perturbating certain FCs that capture little semantic information. With FAA-generated samples, the training can continue the random walk and drift into an area with a flat loss landscape, leading to more robust domain adaptation.

A key difficulty lies in fact in the camera calibration phase. Existing state-of-the-art methods perform the calibration using image processing or keypoint detection techniques that require high-quality video streams, yet typical CCTV footage is low-resolution and noisy. As a result, these methods largely fail in real-world conditions. In contrast, we propose two novel calibration techniques whose only inputs come from an off-the-shelf object detector.

This paper introduces a new face image retrieval framework, where the input face query is augmented by both an adjustment vector that specifies the desired modifications to the facial attributes, and a preference vector that assigns different levels of importance to different attributes. For example, a user can ask for retrieving images similar to a query image, but with a different hair color, and no preference for absence/presence of eyeglasses in the results. To achieve this, we propose to disentangle the semantics, corresponding to various attributes, by learning a set of sparse and orthogonal basis vectors in the latent space of StyleGAN. Such basis vectors are then employed to decompose the dissimilarity between face images in terms of dissimilarity between their attributes, assign preference to the attributes, and adjust the attributes in the query. Enforcing sparsity on the basis vectors helps us to disentangle the latent space and adjust each attribute independently from other attributes, while enforcing orthogonality facilitates preference assignment and the dissimilarity decomposition.

Normalizing flows (NF) have recently emerged as an attractive tool to model such distributions. However, a key drawback is that independent samples drawn from a flow model often do not adequately capture all the modes in the underlying distribution. We propose Likelihood-Based Diverse Sampling (LDS), a method for improving the quality and the diversity of trajectory samples from a pre-trained flow model. Rather than producing individual samples, LDS produces a set of trajectories in one shot. Given a pre-trained forecasting flow model, we train LDS using gradients from the model, to optimize an objective function that rewards high likelihood for individual trajectories in the predicted set, together with high spatial separation among trajectories. LDS outperforms state-of-art post-hoc neural diverse forecasting methods for various pre-trained flow models as well as conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) models.

In Defense of Scene Graphs for Image Captioning,"Kien Nguyen, Subarna Tripathi, Bang Du, Tanaya Guha, Truong Q. Nguyen"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 1407-1416","The mainstream image captioning models rely on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) image features to generate captions via recurrent models. Recently, image scene graphs have been used to augment captioning models so as to leverage their structural semantics such as object entities, relationships and attributes. Several studies have noted that naive use of scene graphs from a black-box scene graph generator harms image captioning performance, and scene graph-based captioning models have to incur the overhead of explicit use of image features to generate decent captions. Addressing these challenges, we propose a framework, SG2Caps, that utilizes only the scene graph labels for competitive image captioning performance. The basic idea is to close the semantic gap between two scene graphs - one derived from the input image and the other one from its caption. In order to achieve this, we leverage the spatial location of objects and the Human-Object-Interaction (HOI) labels as an additional HOI graph. Our framework outperforms existing scene graph-only captioning models by a large margin indicating scene graphs as a promising representation for image captioning. Direct utilization of the scene graph labels avoids expensive graph convolutions over high-dimensional CNN features resulting in 49% fewer trainable parameters.

RS Loss supervises the classifier, a sub-network of these methods, to rank each positive above all negatives as well as to sort positives among themselves with respect to (wrt.) their localisation qualities (e.g. Intersection-over-Union - IoU). To tackle the non-differentiable nature of ranking and sorting, we reformulate the incorporation of error-driven update with backpropagation as Identity Update, which enables us to model our novel sorting error among positives. With RS Loss, we significantly simplify training: (i) Thanks to our sorting objective, the positives are prioritized by the classifier without an additional auxiliary head (e.g. for centerness, IoU, mask-IoU), (ii) due to its ranking-based nature, RS Loss is robust to class imbalance, and thus, no sampling heuristic is required, and (iii) we address the multi-task nature of visual detectors using tuning-free task-balancing coefficients. Using RS Loss, we train seven diverse visual detectors only by tuning the learning rate, and show that it consistently outperforms baselines: e.g. our RS Loss improves (i) Faster R-CNN by 3 box AP and aLRP Loss (ranking-based baseline) by 2 box AP on COCO dataset, (ii) Mask R-CNN with repeat factor sampling (RFS) by 3.5 mask AP ( 7 AP for rare classes) on LVIS dataset; and also outperforms all counterparts.

Recently, self-supervised learning (SSL) with a combination of image-to-image translation shows great effectiveness in adaptive segmentation. The most common practice is to perform SSL along with image translation to well align a single domain (the source or target). However, in this single-domain paradigm, unavoidable visual inconsistency raised by image translation may affect subsequent learning. In this paper, based on the observation that domain adaptation frameworks performed in the source and target domain are almost complementary in terms of image translation and SSL, we propose a novel dual path learning (DPL) framework to alleviate visual inconsistency. Concretely, DPL contains two complementary and interactive single-domain adaptation pipelines aligned in source and target domain respectively. The inference of DPL is extremely simple, only one segmentation model in the target domain is employed. Novel technologies such as dual path image translation and dual path adaptive segmentation are proposed to make two paths promote each other in an interactive manner.

Optimizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification tends to activate local discriminative regions while ignoring complete object extent, causing the partial activation issue. In this paper, we argue that partial activation is caused by the intrinsic characteristics of CNN, where the convolution operations produce local receptive fields and experience difficulty to capture long-range feature dependency among pixels. We introduce the token semantic coupled attention map (TS-CAM) to take full advantage of the self-attention mechanism in visual transformer for long-range dependency extraction. TS-CAM first splits an image into a sequence of patch tokens for spatial embedding, which produce attention maps of long-range visual dependency to avoid partial activation. TS-CAM then re-allocates category-related semantics for patch tokens, enabling each of them to be aware of object categories. TS-CAM finally couples the patch tokens with the semantic-agnostic attention map to achieve semantic-aware localization. Experiments on the ILSVRC/CUB-200-2011 datasets show that TS-CAM outperforms its CNN-CAM counterparts by7.1%/27.1%for WSOL, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

Although theoretically with optimal assumptions, margin-based losses such as the triplet loss and margin loss have a diverse family of solutions. We theoretically prove and empirically show that under reasonable noise assumptions, margin-based losses tend to project all samples of a class with various modes onto a single point in the embedding space, resulting in a class collapse that usually renders the space ill-sorted for classification or retrieval. To address this problem, we propose a simple modification to the embedding losses such that each sample selects its nearest same-class counterpart in a batch as the positive element in the tuple. This allows for the presence of multiple sub-clusters within each class. The adaptation can be integrated into a wide range of metric learning losses.

Currently, lane detection relies on a huge amount of annotated images, which is a heavy burden. Active learning has been proposed to reduce annotation in many computer vision tasks, but no effort has been made for lane detection.

On one hand, most methods evaluate data uncertainties based on entropy, which is undesirable in lane detection because it encourages to select images with very few lanes or even no lane at all. On the other hand, existing methods are not aware of the noise of lane annotations, which is caused by heavy occlusion and unclear lane marks. In this paper, we build a novel knowledge distillation framework and evaluate the uncertainty of images based on the knowledge learnt by the student model.

Using IC pairs we next propose automatic strategies to generate millions of VLN path-instruction (PI) pairs. We further propose a shuffling loss that improves the learning of temporal order inside PI pairs. We use BnB to pretrain our Airbert model that can be adapted to discriminative and generative settings and show that it outperforms state of the art for Room-to-Room (R2R) navigation and Remote Referring Expression (REVERIE) benchmarks. Moreover, our in-domain pretraining significantly increases performance on a challenging few-shot VLN evaluation, where we train the model only on VLN instructions from a few houses.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Guhur_Airbert_In-Domain_Pretraining_for_Vision-and-Language_Navigation_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
Internal Video Inpainting by Implicit Long-Range Propagation,"Hao Ouyang, Tengfei Wang, Qifeng Chen"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2021, pp. 14579-14588","We propose a novel framework for video inpainting by adopting an internal learning strategy. Unlike previous methods that use optical flow for cross-frame context propagation to inpaint unknown regions, we show that this can be achieved implicitly by fitting a convolutional neural network to known regions. Moreover, to handle challenging sequences with ambiguous backgrounds or long-term occlusion, we design two regularization terms to preserve high-frequency details and long-term temporal consistency. Extensive experiments on the DAVIS dataset demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art inpainting quality quantitatively and qualitatively. We further extend the proposed method to another challenging task: learning to remove an object from a video giving a single object mask in only one frame in a 4K video.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Ouyang_Internal_Video_Inpainting_by_Implicit_Long-Range_Propagation_ICCV_2021_paper.html,2021,iccv
