Does Data Repair Lead to Fair Models? Curating Contextually Fair Data To Reduce Model Bias,"Sharat Agarwal, Sumanyu Muku, Saket Anand, Chetan Arora"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 3298-3307","Contextual information is a valuable cue for Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn better representations and improve accuracy. However, co-occurrence bias in the training dataset may hamper a DNN model's generalizability to unseen scenarios in the real world. For example, in COCO [??], many object categories have a much higher co-occurrence with men compared to women, which can bias a DNN's prediction in favor of men. Recent works have focused on task-specific training strategies to handle bias in such scenarios, but fixing the available data is often ignored. In this paper, we propose a novel and more generic solution to address the contextual bias in the datasets by selecting a subset of the samples, which is fair in terms of the co-occurrence with various classes for a protected attribute. We introduce a data repair algorithm using the coefficient of variation(c_v), which can curate fair and contextually balanced data for a protected class(es). This helps in training a fair model irrespective of the task, architecture or training methodology. Our proposed solution is simple, effective and can even be used in an active learning setting where the data labels are not present or being generated incrementally. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm for the task of object detection and multi-label image classification across different datasets. Through a series of experiments, we validate that curating contextually fair data helps make model predictions fair by balancing the true positive rate for the protected class across groups without compromising on the model's overall performance.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Agarwal_Does_Data_Repair_Lead_to_Fair_Models_Curating_Contextually_Fair_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
UNETR: Transformers for 3D Medical Image Segmentation,"Ali Hatamizadeh, Yucheng Tang, Vishwesh Nath, Dong Yang, Andriy Myronenko, Bennett Landman, Holger R. Roth, Daguang Xu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 574-584","Fully Convolutional Neural Networks (FCNNs) with contracting and expanding paths have shown prominence for the majority of medical image segmentation applications since the past decade. In FCNNs, the encoder plays an integral role by learning both global and local features and contextual representations which can be utilized for semantic output prediction by the decoder. Despite their success, the locality of convolutional layers in FCNNs, limits the capability of learning long-range spatial dependencies. Inspired by the recent success of transformers for Natural Language Processing (NLP) in long-range sequence learning, we reformulate the task of volumetric (3D) medical image segmentation as a sequence-to-sequence prediction problem. We introduce a novel architecture, dubbed as UNEt TRansformers (UNETR), that utilizes a transformer as the encoder to learn sequence representations of the input volume and effectively capture the global multi-scale information, while also following the successful ""U-shaped"" network design for the encoder and decoder. The transformer encoder is directly connected to a decoder via skip connections at different resolutions to compute the final semantic segmentation output. We have validated the performance of our method on the Multi Atlas Labeling Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV) dataset for multi-organ segmentation and the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) dataset for brain tumor and spleen segmentation tasks. Our benchmarks demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance on the BTCV leaderboard.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Hatamizadeh_UNETR_Transformers_for_3D_Medical_Image_Segmentation_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
SIDE: Center-Based Stereo 3D Detector With Structure-Aware Instance Depth Estimation,"Xidong Peng, Xinge Zhu, Tai Wang, Yuexin Ma"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 119-128","3D detection plays an indispensable role in environment perception. Due to the high cost of commonly used LiDAR sensor, stereo vision based 3D detection, as an economical yet effective setting, attracts more attention recently. For these approaches based on 2D images, accurate depth information is the key to achieve 3D detection, and most existing methods resort to a preliminary stage for depth estimation. They mainly focus on the global depth and neglect the property of depth information in this specific task, namely, sparsity and locality, where exactly accurate depth is only needed for these 3D bounding boxes. Motivated by this finding, we propose a stereo-image based anchor-free 3D detection method, called structure-aware stereo 3D detector (termed as SIDE), where we explore the instance-level depth information via constructing the cost volume from RoIs of each object. Due to the information sparsity of local cost volume, we further introduce match reweighting and structure-aware attention, to make the depth information more concentrated. Experiments conducted on the KITTI dataset show that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance compared to existing methods without depth map supervision.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Peng_SIDE_Center-Based_Stereo_3D_Detector_With_Structure-Aware_Instance_Depth_Estimation_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
GraN-GAN: Piecewise Gradient Normalization for Generative Adversarial Networks,"Vineeth S. Bhaskara, Tristan Aumentado-Armstrong, Allan D. Jepson, Alex Levinshtein"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 3821-3830","Modern generative adversarial networks (GANs) predominantly use piecewise linear activation functions in discriminators (or critics), including ReLU and LeakyReLU. Such models learn piecewise linear mappings, where each piece handles a subset of the input space, and the gradients per subset are piecewise constant. Under such a class of discriminator (or critic) functions, we present Gradient Normalization (GraN), a novel input-dependent normalization method, which guarantees a piecewise K-Lipschitz constraint in the input space. In contrast to spectral normalization, GraN does not constrain processing at the individual network layers, and, unlike gradient penalties, strictly enforces a piecewise Lipschitz constraint almost everywhere. Empirically, we demonstrate improved image generation performance across multiple datasets (incl. CIFAR-10/100, STL-10, LSUN bedrooms, and CelebA), GAN loss functions, and metrics. Further, we analyze altering the often untuned Lipschitz constant K in several standard GANs, not only attaining significant performance gains, but also finding connections between K and training dynamics, particularly in low-gradient loss plateaus, with the common Adam optimizer.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Bhaskara_GraN-GAN_Piecewise_Gradient_Normalization_for_Generative_Adversarial_Networks_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
Meta-UDA: Unsupervised Domain Adaptive Thermal Object Detection Using Meta-Learning,"Vibashan VS, Domenick Poster, Suya You, Shuowen Hu, Vishal M. Patel"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 1412-1423","Object detectors trained on large-scale RGB datasets are being extensively employed in real-world applications. However, these RGB-trained models suffer a performance drop under adverse illumination and lighting conditions. Infrared (IR) cameras are robust under such conditions and can be helpful in real-world applications. Though thermal cameras are widely used for military applications and increasingly for commercial applications, there is a lack of robust algorithms to robustly exploit the thermal imagery due to the limited availability of labeled thermal data. In this work, we aim to enhance the object detection performance in the thermal domain by leveraging the labeled visible domain data in an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) setting. We propose an algorithm agnostic meta-learning framework to improve existing UDA methods instead of proposing a new UDA strategy. We achieve this by meta-learning the initial condition of the detector, which facilitates the adaptation process with fine updates without overfitting or getting stuck at local optima. However, meta-learning the initial condition for the detection scenario is computationally heavy due to long and intractable computation graphs. Therefore, we propose an online meta-learning paradigm which performs online updates resulting in a short and tractable computation graph. To this end, we demonstrate the superiority of our method over many baselines in the UDA setting, producing a state-of-the-art thermal detector for the KAIST and DSIAC datasets. Source code will be made publicly available after the review process.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/VS_Meta-UDA_Unsupervised_Domain_Adaptive_Thermal_Object_Detection_Using_Meta-Learning_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
Multi-Level Attentive Adversarial Learning With Temporal Dilation for Unsupervised Video Domain Adaptation,"Peipeng Chen, Yuan Gao, Andy J. Ma"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 1259-1268","Most existing works on unsupervised video domain adaptation attempt to mitigate the distribution gap across domains in frame and video levels. Such two-level distribution alignment approach may suffer from the problems of insufficient alignment for complex video data and misalignment along the temporal dimension. To address these issues, we develop a novel framework of Multi-level Attentive Adversarial Learning with Temporal Dilation (MA2L-TD). Given frame-level features as input, multi-level temporal features are generated and multiple domain discriminators are individually trained by adversarial learning for them. For better distribution alignment, level-wise attention weights are calculated by the degree of domain confusion in each level. To mitigate the negative effect of misalignment, features are aggregated with the attention mechanism determined by individual domain discriminators. Moreover, temporal dilation is designed for sequential non-repeatability to balance the computational efficiency and the possible number of levels. Extensive experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the state of the arts on four benchmark datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Chen_Multi-Level_Attentive_Adversarial_Learning_With_Temporal_Dilation_for_Unsupervised_Video_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

In this paper, we propose Kinetic-GAN, a novel architecture that leverages the benefits of Generative Adversarial Networks and Graph Convolutional Networks to synthesise the kinetics of the human body. The proposed adversarial architecture can condition up to 120 different actions over local and global body movements while improving sample quality and diversity through latent space disentanglement and stochastic variations. Our experiments were carried out in three well-known datasets, where Kinetic-GAN notably surpasses the state-of-the-art methods in terms of distribution quality metrics while having the ability to synthesise more than one order of magnitude regarding the number of different actions.

Non-Blind Deblurring for Fluorescence: A Deformable Latent Space Approach With Kernel Parameterization,"Ziqiao Guan, Esther H. R. Tsai, Xiaojing Huang, Kevin G. Yager, Hong Qin"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 711-719","Non-blind deblurring (NBD) is a modeling method of the image deblurring problem in computer vision, where the blurring kernel is known or can be externally estimated. In this paper, we attempt to solve a parametric NBD problem, inspired by the simultaneous acquisition of ptychography and fluorescent imaging (FI). Ptychography is an imaging method that favors larger probes, i.e. convolutional kernels, while FI relies on a small probe for high resolution. Also, the kernel can be solved during ptychographic reconstruction. With Ptycho-FI using the same larger kernel, we can perform NBD on the blurred fluorescent images to achieve high-resolution FI, and thus speed up the experiments. To this end, we design a deep latent space deformation network that is directly parameterized by the kernel. The network consists of three components: encoder, deformer, and decoder, where the deformer is specifically meant to rectify the latent space representations of blurred images to a standard latent space, regardless of the kernel. The deformation network is trained with a two-stage training scheme. We conduct extensive experiments to confirm that our parametric model can adapt to drastically different blurring kernels and perform robust deblurring.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Guan_Non-Blind_Deblurring_for_Fluorescence_A_Deformable_Latent_Space_Approach_With_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
Few-Shot Open-Set Recognition of Hyperspectral Images With Outlier Calibration Network,"Debabrata Pal, Valay Bundele, Renuka Sharma, Biplab Banerjee, Yogananda Jeppu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 3801-3810","We tackle the few-shot open-set recognition (FSOSR) problem in the context of remote sensing hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. Prior research on OSR mainly considers an empirical threshold on the class prediction scores to reject the outlier samples. Further, recent endeavors in few-shot HSI classification fail to recognize outliers due to the `closed-set' nature of the problem and the fact that the entire class distributions are unknown during training. To this end, we propose to optimize a novel outlier calibration network (OCN) together with a feature extraction module during the meta-training phase. The feature extractor is equipped with a novel residual 3D convolutional block attention network (R3CBAM) for enhanced spectral-spatial feature learning from HSI. Our method rejects the outliers based on OCN prediction scores barring the need for manual thresholding. Finally, we propose to augment the query set with synthesized support set features during the similarity learning stage in order to combat the data scarcity issue of few-shot learning.

SBEVNet: End-to-End Deep Stereo Layout Estimation,"Divam Gupta, Wei Pu, Trenton Tabor, Jeff Schneider"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 523-532","Accurate layout estimation is crucial for planning and navigation in robotics applications, such as self-driving. In this paper, we introduce the Stereo Bird's Eye ViewNetwork (SBEVNet), a novel supervised end-to-end framework for estimation of bird's eye view layout from a pair of stereo images. Although our network reuses some of the building blocks from the state-of-the-art deep learning networks for disparity estimation, we show that explicit depth estimation is neither sufficient nor necessary. Instead, the learning of a good internal bird's eye view feature representation is effective for layout estimation. Specifically, we first generate a disparity feature volume using the features of the stereo images and then project it to the bird's eye view coordinates. This gives us coarse-grained information about the scene structure. We also apply inverse perspective mapping (IPM) to map the input images and their features to the bird's eye view. This gives us fine-grained texture information. Concatenating IPM features with the projected feature volume creates a rich bird's eye view representation which is useful for spatial reasoning. We use this representation to estimate the BEV semantic map. Additionally, we show that using the IPM features as a supervisory signal for stereo features can give an improvement in performance. We demonstrate our approach on two datasets:the KITTI dataset and a synthetically generated dataset from the CARLA simulator. For both of these datasets, we establish state-of-the-art performance compared to baseline techniques.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Gupta_SBEVNet_End-to-End_Deep_Stereo_Layout_Estimation_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
F-CAM: Full Resolution Class Activation Maps via Guided Parametric Upscaling,"Soufiane Belharbi, Aydin Sarraf, Marco Pedersoli, Ismail Ben Ayed, Luke McCaffrey, Eric Granger"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 3490-3499","Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods have recently gained much attention for weakly-supervised object localization (WSOL) tasks. They allow for CNN visualization and interpretation without training on fully annotated image datasets. CAM methods are typically integrated within off-the-shelf CNN backbones, such as ResNet50. Due to convolution and pooling operations, these backbones yield low resolution CAMs with a down-scaling factor of up to 32, contributing to inaccurate localizations. Interpolation is required to restore full size CAMs, yet it does not consider the statistical properties of objects, such as color and texture, leading to activations with inconsistent boundaries, and inaccurate localizations. As an alternative, we introduce a generic method for parametric upscaling of CAMs that allows constructing accurate full resolution CAMs (F-CAMs). In particular, we propose a trainable decoding architecture that can be connected to any CNN classifier to produce highly accurate CAM localizations. Given an original low resolution CAM, foreground and background pixels are randomly sampled to fine-tune the decoder. Additional priors such as image statistics and size constraints are also considered to expand and refine object boundaries. Extensive experiments, over three CNN backbones and six WSOL baselines on the CUB-200-2011 and OpenImages datasets, indicate that our F-CAM method yields a significant improvement in CAM localization accuracy. F-CAM performance is competitive with state-of-art WSOL methods, yet it requires fewer computations during inference.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Belharbi_F-CAM_Full_Resolution_Class_Activation_Maps_via_Guided_Parametric_Upscaling_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

We uncover that while all three saliency cropping frameworks considered in this paper do exhibit acute racial and gender biases, Twitter's saliency cropping framework uniquely elicits high male-gaze cropping prevalence rates. In order to facilitate reproducing the results presented here, we are open-sourcing both the code and the datasets that we curated at shorturl.at/iuzK9.

As computational resources improve, a great deal of effort has been placed on efficiently scaling up existing designs and generating new architectures with Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithms. While network topology has proven to be a critical factor for model performance, we show that significant gains are being left on the table by keeping topology static at inference-time. Due to challenges such as scale variation, we should not expect static models configured to perform well across a training dataset to be optimally configured to handle all test data. In this work, we expose the exciting potential of inference-time-dynamic models. We show that by allowing just four layers to dynamically change configuration at inference-time, off-the-shelf models like ResNet-50 have an upper bound accuracy of over 95% on ImageNet. This level of performance currently exceeds that of models with over 20x more parameters and significantly more complex training procedures.

In high-stakes situations such as healthcare, there is a need for explainable AI (XAI) tools that can help open up this black box. In contrast to approaches which largely tackle classification problems in the medical imaging domain, we address the less-studied problem of explainable image retrieval. We test our approach on a COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset and the ISIC 2017 skin lesion dataset, showing that saliency maps help reveal the image features used by models to determine image similarity. We evaluated three different saliency algorithms, which were either occlusion-based, attention-based, or relied on a form of activation mapping. We also develop quantitative evaluation metrics that allow us to go beyond simple qualitative comparisons of the different saliency algorithms.

On the Effectiveness of Small Input Noise for Defending Against Query-Based Black-Box Attacks,"Junyoung Byun, Hyojun Go, Changick Kim"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 3051-3060","While deep neural networks show unprecedented performance in various tasks, the vulnerability to adversarial examples hinders their deployment in safety-critical systems. Many studies have shown that attacks are also possible even in a black-box setting where an adversary cannot access the target model's internal information. Most black-box attacks are based on queries, each of which obtains the target model's output for an input, and many recent studies focus on reducing the number of required queries. In this paper, we pay attention to an implicit assumption of query-based black-box adversarial attacks that the target model's output exactly corresponds to the query input. If some randomness is introduced into the model, it can break the assumption, and thus, query-based attacks may have tremendous difficulty in both gradient estimation and local search, which are the core of their attack process. From this motivation, we observe even a small additive input noise can neutralize most query-based attacks and name this simple yet effective approach Small Noise Defense (SND). We analyze how SND can defend against query-based black-box attacks and demonstrate its effectiveness against eight state-of-the-art attacks with CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Even with strong defense ability, SND almost maintains the original classification accuracy and computational speed.

Instead of scanning all reference videos, the query video segment does a fast KNN search in the global feature database. The returned results are used to generate a shortlist of candidate videos.

However, this constrains detection systems to a finite set of known classes and prevents generalisation to unknown objects or behaviours.

Attack Agnostic Detection of Adversarial Examples via Random Subspace Analysis,"Nathan Drenkow, Neil Fendley, Philippe Burlina"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 472-482","Whilst adversarial attack detection has received considerable attention, it remains a fundamentally challenging problem from two perspectives. First, while threat models can be well-defined, attacker strategies may still vary widely within those constraints. Therefore, detection should be considered as an open-set problem, standing in contrast to most current detection approaches. These methods take a closed-set view and train binary detectors, thus biasing detection toward attacks seen during detector training. Second, limited information is available at test time and typically confounded by nuisance factors including the label and underlying content of the image. We address these challenges via a novel strategy based on random subspace analysis. We present a technique that utilizes properties of random projections to characterize the behavior of clean and adversarial examples across a diverse set of subspaces. The self-consistency (or inconsistency) of model activations is leveraged to discern clean from adversarial examples. Performance evaluations demonstrate that our technique (AUC [0.92, 0.98]) outperforms competing detection strategies (AUC [0.30,0.79]), while remaining truly agnostic to the attack strategy (for both targeted/untargeted attacks).

This gives reason to believe that 3D extensions of such convolutions should also yield performance improvements for video-level segmentation tasks. However, this aspect has not yet been explored thoroughly in existing literature. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Dilated Convolutions (D2Conv3D): a novel type of convolution which draws inspiration from dilated and deformable convolutions and extends them to the 3D (spatio-temporal) domain. We experimentally show that D2Conv3D can be used to improve the performance of multiple 3D CNN architectures across multiple video segmentation related benchmarks by simply employing D2Conv3D as a drop-in replacement for standard convolutions. We further show that D2Conv3D out-performs trivial extensions of existing dilated and deformable convolutions to 3D. Lastly, we set a new state-of-the-art on the DAVIS 2016 Unsupervised Video Object Segmentation benchmark.

Multi-Motion and Appearance Self-Supervised Moving Object Detection,"Fan Yang, Srikrishna Karanam, Meng Zheng, Terrence Chen, Haibin Ling, Ziyan Wu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 2605-2614","In this work, we consider the problem of self-supervised Moving Object Detection (MOD) in video, where no ground truth is involved in both training and inference phases. Recently, an adversarial learning framework is proposed to leverage inherent temporal information for MOD. While showing great promising results, it uses single scale temporal information and may meet problems when dealing with a deformable object under multi-scale motion in different parts. Additional challenges can arise from the moving camera, which results in the failure of the motion independence hypothesis and locally independent background motion. To deal with these problems, we propose a Multi-motion and Appearance Self-supervised Network (MASNet) to introduce multi-scale motion information and appearance information of scene for MOD. In particular, a moving object, especially the deformable, usually consists of moving regions at various temporal scales. Introducing multi-scale motion can aggregate these regions to form a more complete detection. Appearance information can serve as another cue for MOD when the motion independence is not reliable and for removing false detection in background caused by locally independent background motion. To encode multi-scale motion and appearance, in MASNet we respectively design a multi-branch flow encoding module and an image inpainter module. The proposed modules and MASNet are extensively evaluated on the DAVIS dataset to demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority to state-of-the-art self-supervised methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Yang_Multi-Motion_and_Appearance_Self-Supervised_Moving_Object_Detection_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

Pixel-Level Bijective Matching for Video Object Segmentation,"Suhwan Cho, Heansung Lee, Minjung Kim, Sungjun Jang, Sangyoun Lee"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 129-138","Semi-supervised video object segmentation (VOS) aims to track a designated object present in the initial frame of a video at the pixel level. To fully exploit the appearance information of an object, pixel-level feature matching is widely used in VOS. Conventional feature matching runs in a surjective manner, i.e., only the best matches from the query frame to the reference frame are considered. Each location in the query frame refers to the optimal location in the reference frame regardless of how often each reference frame location is referenced. This works well in most cases and is robust against rapid appearance variations, but may cause critical errors when the query frame contains background distractors that look similar to the target object. To mitigate this concern, we introduce a bijective matching mechanism to find the best matches from the query frame to the reference frame and vice versa. Before finding the best matches for the query frame pixels, the optimal matches for the reference frame pixels are first considered to prevent each reference frame pixel from being overly referenced. As this mechanism operates in a strict manner, i.e., pixels are connected if and only if they are the sure matches for each other, it can effectively eliminate background distractors. In addition, we propose a mask embedding module to improve the existing mask propagation method. By utilizing multiple historic masks and their variations, it can effectively capture the position information of a target object.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Cho_Pixel-Level_Bijective_Matching_for_Video_Object_Segmentation_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
Unveiling Real-Life Effects of Online Photo Sharing,"Van-Khoa Nguyen, Adrian Popescu, Jérôme Deshayes-Chossart"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 2898-2908","Social networks give free access to their services in exchange for the right to exploit their users' data. Data sharing is done in an initial context which is chosen by the users. However, data are used by social networks and third parties in different contexts which are often not transparent. In order to unveil such usages, we propose an approach which focuses on the effects of data sharing in impactful real-life situations. Focus is put on visual content because of its strong influence in shaping online user profiles. The approach relies on three components: (1) a set of concepts with associated situation impact ratings obtained by crowdsourcing, (2) a corresponding set of object detectors for mining users' photos and (3) a ground truth dataset made of 500 visual user profiles which are manually rated per situation. These components are combined in LERVUP, a method which learns to rate visual user profiles in each situation. LERVUP exploits a new image descriptor which aggregates concept ratings and object detections at user level and an attention mechanism which boosts highly-rated concepts to prevent them from being overwhelmed by low-rated ones. Performance is evaluated per situation by measuring the correlation between the automatic ranking of profile ratings and a manual ground truth. Results indicate that LERVUP is effective since a strong correlation of the two rankings is obtained. A practical implementation of the approach in a mobile app which raises user awareness about shared data usage is also discussed.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Nguyen_Unveiling_Real-Life_Effects_of_Online_Photo_Sharing_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
HierMatch: Leveraging Label Hierarchies for Improving Semi-Supervised Learning,"Ashima Garg, Shaurya Bagga, Yashvardhan Singh, Saket Anand"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 1015-1024","Semi-supervised learning approaches have emerged as an active area of research to combat the challenge of obtaining large amounts of annotated data. Towards the goal of improving the performance of semi-supervised learning methods, we propose a novel framework, HIERMATCH, a semi-supervised approach that leverages hierarchical information to reduce labeling costs and performs as well as a vanilla semi-supervised learning method. Hierarchical information is often available as prior knowledge in the form of coarse labels (e.g., woodpeckers) for images with fine-grained labels (e.g., downy woodpeckers or golden-fronted woodpeckers). However, the use of supervision using coarse-category labels to improve semi-supervised techniques has not been explored. In the absence of fine-grained labels, HIERMATCH exploits the label hierarchy and uses coarse class labels as a weak supervisory signal. Additionally, HIERMATCH is a generic-approach to improve any semi-supervised learning framework, we demonstrate this using our results on recent state-of-the-art techniques MixMatch and FixMatch. We evaluate the efficacy of HIERMATCH on two benchmark datasets, namely CIFAR-100 and NABirds. HIERMATCH can reduce the usage of fine-grained labels by 50% on CIFAR-100 with only a marginal drop of 0.59% in top-1 accuracy as compared to MixMatch.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Garg_HierMatch_Leveraging_Label_Hierarchies_for_Improving_Semi-Supervised_Learning_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
Mobile Based Human Identification Using Forehead Creases: Application and Assessment Under COVID-19 Masked Face Scenarios,"Rohit Bharadwaj, Gaurav Jaswal, Aditya Nigam, Kamlesh Tiwari"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 3693-3701","In the COVID-19 situation, face masks have become an essential part of our daily life. As mask occludes most prominent facial characteristics, it brings new challenges to the existing facial recognition systems. This paper presents an idea to consider forehead creases (under surprise facial expression) as a new biometric modality to authenticate mask-wearing faces. The forehead biometrics utilizes the creases and textural skin patterns appearing due to voluntary contraction of the forehead region as features. The proposed framework is an efficient and generalizable deep learning framework for forehead recognition. Face-selfie images are collected using smartphone's frontal camera in an unconstrained environment with various indoor/outdoor realistic environments. Acquired forehead images are first subjected to a segmentation model that results in rectangular Region Of Interest (ROI's). A set of convolutional feature maps are subsequently obtained using a backbone network. The primary embeddings are enriched using a dual attention network (DANet) to induce discriminative feature learning. The attention-empowered embeddings are then optimized using Large Margin Cosine Loss (LMCL) followed by Focal Loss to update weights for inducting robust training and better feature discriminating capabilities. Our system is end-to-end and few-shot; thus, it is very efficient in memory requirements and recognition rate. Besides, we present a forehead image dataset that has been recorded in two sessions from 247 subjects containing a total of 4,964 selfie-face mask images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first to date mobile-based forehead dataset and is being made available along with the mobile application in the public domain.

However, recording binaural audio requires specialized setup with a dummy human head having microphones in left and right ears. Such a recording setup is difficult to build and setup, therefore mono audio has become the preferred choice in common devices. To obtain the same impact as binaural audio, recent efforts have been directed towards lifting mono audio to binaural audio conditioned on the visual input from the scene. Such approaches have not used an important cue for the task: the distance of different sound producing objects from the microphones. In this work, we argue that depth map of the scene can act as a proxy for inducing distance information of different objects in the scene, for the task of audio binauralization. We propose a novel encoder-decoder architecture with a hierarchical attention mechanism to encode image, depth and audio feature jointly. We design the network on top of state-of-the-art transformer networks for image and depth representation.

The loss function should encourage natural and perceptually pleasing results. A popular choice for a loss is a pre-trained network, such as VGG, which is used as a feature extractor for computing the difference between restored and reference images. However, such an approach has multiple drawbacks: it is computationally expensive, requires regularization and hyper-parameter tuning, and involves a large network trained on an unrelated task. Furthermore, it has been observed that there is no single loss function that works best across all applications and across different datasets. In this work, we instead propose to train a set of loss functions that are application specific in nature. Our loss function comprises a series of discriminators that are trained to detect and penalize the presence of application-specific artefacts. We show that a single natural image and corresponding distortions are sufficient to train our feature extractor that outperforms state-of-the-art loss functions in applications like single image super resolution, denoising, and JPEG artefact removal.

To synthesize the absent freehand sketches from photos, we propose a framework that jointly learns sketch-to-photo and photo-to-sketch generation.

In this work, we revisit shadow art using differentiable rendering-based optimization frameworks to obtain the 3D sculpture from a set of shadow (binary) images and their corresponding projection information. Specifically, we discuss shape optimization through voxel as well as mesh-based differentiable renderers. Our choice of using differentiable rendering for generating shadow art sculptures can be attributed to its ability to learn the underlying 3D geometry solely from image data, thus reducing the dependence on 3D ground truth.

Towards Class-Oriented Poisoning Attacks Against Neural Networks,"Bingyin Zhao, Yingjie Lao"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 3741-3750","Poisoning attacks on machine learning systems compromise the model performance by deliberately injecting malicious samples in the training dataset to influence the training process. Prior works focus on either availability attacks (i.e., lowering the overall model accuracy) or integrity attacks (i.e., enabling specific instance-based backdoor). In this paper, we advance the adversarial objectives of the availability attacks to a per-class basis, which we refer to as class-oriented poisoning attacks. We demonstrate that the proposed attack is capable of forcing the corrupted model to predict in two specific ways: (i) classify unseen new images to a targeted ""supplanter"" class, and (ii) misclassify images from a ""victim"" class while maintaining the classification accuracy on other non-victim classes. To maximize the adversarial effect as well as reduce the computational complexity of poisoned data generation, we propose a gradient-based framework that crafts poisoning images with carefully manipulated feature information for each scenario. Using newly defined metrics at the class level, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed class-oriented poisoning attacks on various models (e.g., LeNet-5, Vgg-9, and ResNet-50) over a wide range of datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-ILSVRC2012) in an end-to-end training setting.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Zhao_Towards_Class-Oriented_Poisoning_Attacks_Against_Neural_Networks_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
Transfer Learning for Pose Estimation of Illustrated Characters,"Shuhong Chen, Matthias Zwicker"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 793-802","Human pose information is a critical component in many downstream image processing tasks, such as activity recognition and motion tracking.

However, scene understanding of human exceeds recognizing individual objects separately: the contextual information among multiple objects such as visual relational information (e.g. visually similar objects) and semantic relational information (e.g. co-occurrences) is helpful for understanding of visual scene. In this paper, we verify that contextual information plays a more important role in ZSD than in traditional object detection. To make full use of such information, we propose a new end-to-end ZSD method GRaph Aligning Network (GRAN) based on graph modeling and reasoning which simultaneously considers visual and semantic information of multiple objects instead of individual objects. Specifically, we formulate a Visual Relational Graph (VRG) and a Semantic Relational Graph (SRG), where the nodes are the objects in the image and the semantic representations of classes respectively and the edges are the relevance between nodes in each graph. To characterize mutual effect between two modalities, the two graphs are further merged into a heterogeneous Visual-Semantic Relational Graph (VSRG), where modal translators are designed for the two subgraphs to enable modal information to transform into a common space for communication, and message passing among nodes is enforced to refine their representations.

Electricity consumption assessment is difficult to do in settings where a significant fraction of households do not yet have an electricity connection. In such settings the absolute levels of anticipated consumption can range from 5-100 kWh/month, leading to high variability amongst these customers. Precious resources are at stake if a significant fraction of low consumers are connected over those with higher consumption. This is the first study of it's kind in low-income settings that attempts to predict a building's consumption and not that of an aggregate administrative area. We train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) over pre-electrification daytime satellite imagery with a sample of utility bills from 20,000 geo-referenced electricity customers in Kenya (0.01% of Kenya's residential customers). This is made possible with a two-stage approach that uses a novel building segmentation approach to leverage much larger volumes of no-cost satellite imagery to make the most of scarce and expensive customer data. Our method shows that competitive accuracies can be achieved at the building level, addressing the challenge of consumption variability. This work shows that the building's characteristics and it's surrounding context are both important in predicting consumption levels.

Our work suitably exploits the image formation model in a MVPS experimental setup to recover the dense 3D reconstruction of an object from images. We procure the surface orientation using a photometric stereo (PS) image formation model and blend it with a multi-view neural radiance field representation to recover the object's surface geometry. Contrary to the previous multi-staged framework to MVPS, where the position, iso-depth contours, or orientation measurements are estimated independently and then fused later, our method is simple to implement and realize. Our method performs neural rendering of multi-view images while utilizing surface normals estimated by a deep photometric stereo network.

Fast and Efficient Restoration of Extremely Dark Light Fields,"Mohit Lamba, Kaushik Mitra"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 1361-1370","The ability of Light Field (LF) cameras to capture the 3D geometry of a scene in a single photographic exposure has become central to several applications ranging from passive depth estimation to autonomous driving. But these applications cannot rely on LF captured in low-light conditions due to excessive noise and poor image photometry. The existing low-light enhancement techniques are inappropriate for mitigating this problem as they do not leverage LF's multi-view perspective and give blurry restorations. The recent L3Fnet algorithm alleviates this problem reasonably, but its enormous time and memory complexity make it unaffordable for real-world applications. Thus, we propose a three-stage network that is simultaneously much faster and more accurate. We are more accurate because the three stages compute three complementary features: global, local, and view specific features, which are then fused by our RNN inspired feedforward network to restore LF views. We are faster because we restore multiple views simultaneously and so require less number of forward passes. Besides these advantages, our network is flexible enough to restore a m xm LF during inference even if trained for a smaller n xn (n<m) LF without any finetuning. Extensive experiments on real low-light LF demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art, our model can achieve up to 1 dB higher restoration PSNR, with 9 xspeedup, 23% smaller model size and about 5 xlower floating-point operations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Lamba_Fast_and_Efficient_Restoration_of_Extremely_Dark_Light_Fields_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

Based on the observation that the activation patterns in SR networks exhibit high input-dependency, we propose Multi-Dimensional Dynamic Model Compression method that can reduce both spatial and channel wise redundancy in an SR deep network for different input images. To reduce the spatial-wise redundancy, we propose to perform convolution on scaled-down feature-maps where the down-scaling factor is made adaptive to different input images. To reduce the channel-wise redundancy, we introduce a low-cost channel saliency predictor for each convolution to dynamically skip the computation of unimportant channels based on the Gumbel-Softmax.

While polynomial models are used pervasively in software ranging from PhotoShop to OpenCV to Blender, they have an often overlooked behavior: polynomial models can fold back onto themselves. This property often goes unnoticed when simply warping to undistort an image. However, in applications such as augmented reality where 3D scene geometry is projected and distorted to overlay an image, this folding can result in a surprising behavior. Points well outside the field of view can project into the middle of the image. The domain of a radial distortion model is only valid up to some (possibly infinite) maximum radius where this folding occurs. This paper derives the closed form expression for the maximum valid radius and demonstrates how this value can be used to filter invalid projections or validate the range of an estimated lens model.

Recently, research has shown that unsupervised learning, such as clustering, tends to be vulnerable due to adversarial attack. In this paper, we focus on a clustering algorithm widely used in the real-world environment, namely, ensemble clustering (EC). EC algorithms usually leverage basic partition (BP) and ensemble techniques to improve the clustering performance collaboratively. Each BP may stem from one trial of clustering, feature segment, or part of data stored on the cloud. We have observed that the attack tends to be less perceivable when only a few BPs are compromised. To explore plausible attack strategies, we propose a novel generative adversarial attack (GA2) model for EC, titled GA2EC. First, we show that not all BPs are equally important, and some of them are more vulnerable under adversarial attack. Second, we develop a generative adversarial model to mimic the attack on EC. In particular, the generative model will simulate behaviors of both clean BPs and perturbed key BPs, and their derived graphs, and thus can launch effective attacks with less attention. We have conducted extensive experiments on eleven clustering benchmarks and have demonstrated that our approach is effective in attacking EC under both transductive and inductive settings.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Kumar_Generative_Adversarial_Attack_on_Ensemble_Clustering_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

Despite efforts to disentangle the attributes, a request to change one attribute often triggers unwanted changes to other attributes as well.

We propose an approach where a neural network takes as input the latent encoding of a face and the desired attribute changes and outputs the latent space encoding of the edited image. The network is trained offline using unsupervised data, with training labels generated by an off-the-shelf attribute classifier.

The number of attributes the mapper can simultaneously modify is only limited by the attributes available to the classifier -- we trained a network that handles 35 attributes, more than any previous approach. As no optimization is performed at deployment time, the computation time is negligible, allowing real-time attribute editing. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons with the current state-of-the-art show our method is better at conserving the identity of the face and restricting changes to the requested attributes.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Khodadadeh_Latent_to_Latent_A_Learned_Mapper_for_Identity_Preserving_Editing_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

The attention mechanism of transformers scales quadratically with the length of the input sequence, and unrolled images have long sequence lengths. Plus, transformers lack an inductive bias that is appropriate for images. We tested three modifications to vision transformer (ViT) architectures that address these shortcomings. Firstly, we alleviate the quadratic bottleneck by using linear attention mechanisms, called X-formers (such that, X in Performer, Linformer, Nystromformer ), thereby creating Vision X-formers (ViXs). This resulted in up to a seven times reduction in the GPU memory requirement. We also compared their performance with FNet and multi-layer perceptron mixers, which further reduced the GPU memory requirement. Secondly, we introduced an inductive prior for images by replacing the initial linear embedding layer by convolutional layers in ViX, which significantly increased classification accuracy without increasing the model size. Thirdly, we replaced the learnable 1D position embeddings in ViT with Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE), which increases the classification accuracy for the same model size.

The practical sparsity patterns are non-structural and randomly located on feature maps with non-identical shapes. However, the existing feature map sparsity works take computing efficiency as the primary goal, thereby they can only remove structural sparsity and fail to match the above characteristics.

However, real images often vary in their degradation kernels, thus a single kernel-specific SR approach does not often produce accurate HR results. Recently, degradation-aware networks are introduced to generate blind SR results for unknown kernel conditions. They can restore images for multiple blur kernels, however they have to compromise in quality compared to their kernel-specific counterparts. To address this issue, we propose a novel blind SR method called Mixture of Experts Super-Resolution (MoESR), which uses different experts for different degradation kernels. A broad space of degradation kernels is covered by kernel-specific SR networks (experts). We present an accurate kernel prediction method (gating mechanism) by evaluating the sharpness of images generated by experts. Based on the predicted kernel our most suited expert network is selected for the input image. Finally, we fine-tune the selected network on the test image itself to leverage the advantage of internal learning.

We disentangle those components so as to further analyze especially the temperature and improve the components respectively.

However, existing structured pruning methods often result in significant accuracy degradation for moderate pruning levels. To address this problem, we introduce a new Hessian Aware Pruning (HAP) method coupled with a Neural Implant approach that uses second-order sensitivity as a metric for structured pruning. The basic idea is to prune insensitive components and to use a Neural Implant for moderately sensitive components, instead of completely pruning them. For the latter approach, the moderately sensitive components are replaced with a low-rank implant that is smaller and less computationally expensive than the original component. We use the relative Hessian trace to measure sensitivity, as opposed to the magnitude-based sensitivity metric commonly used in the literature. We test HAP for both computer vision tasks and natural language tasks, and we achieve new state-of-the-art results. Specifically,HAP achieves less than 0.1%/0.5% degradation on PreResNet29/ResNet50(CIFAR-10/ImageNet) with more than 70%/50% of parameters pruned.

To protect from such examples, various defense strategies have been proposed. A very recent defense strategy for detecting adversarial examples, that has been shown to be robust to current attacks, is to check for intrinsic context consistencies in the input data, where context refers to various relationships (e.g., object-to-object co-occurrence relationships) in images. In this paper, we show that even context consistency checks can be brittle to properly crafted adversarial examples and to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do so. Specifically, we propose an adaptive framework to generate examples that subvert such defenses, namely, Adversarial attacks against object Detection that evade Context consistency checks (ADC).

One solution is to train a supervised deep neural network on many digital images and their smartphone-scanned versions. However, it requires a high labor cost, leading to limited training data. Previous works create training pairs by simulating degradation using low-level image processing techniques. Their synthetic images are then formed with perfectly scanned photos in latent space. Even so, the real-world degradation in smartphone photo scanning remains unsolved since it is more complicated due to lens defocus, low-cost cameras, losing details via printing. Besides, locally structural misalignment still occurs in data due to distorted shapes captured in a 3-D world, reducing restoration performance and the reliability of the quantitative evaluation. To address these problems, we propose a semi-supervised Deep Photo Scan (DPScan). First, we present a way of producing real-world degradation and provide the DIV2K-SCAN dataset for smartphone-scanned photo restoration. Also, Local Alignment is proposed to reduce the minor misalignment remaining in data. Second, we simulate many different variants of the real-world degradation using low-level image transformation to gain a generalization in smartphone-scanned image properties, then train a degradation network to generalize all styles of degradation and provide pseudo-scanned photos for unscanned images as if they were scanned by a smartphone. Finally, we propose a Semi-Supervised Learning that allows our restoration network to be trained on both scanned and unscanned images, diversifying training image content.

MAML is to learn an initialization so that a model can adapt to a new task in a few steps. However, since the gradient norm of a classifier (head) is much bigger than those of backbone layers, the model focuses on learning the decision boundary of the classifier with similar representations. Furthermore, gradient norms of high-level layers are small than those of the other layers. So, the backbone of MAML usually learns task-generic features, which results in deteriorated adaptation performance in the inner-loop. To resolve or mitigate this problem, we propose contextual gradient scaling (CxGrad), which scales gradient norms of the backbone to facilitate learning task-specific knowledge in the inner-loop. Since the scaling factors are generated from task-conditioned parameters, gradient norms of the backbone can be scaled in a task-wise fashion.

Its implementation is ubiquitous in all display devices and image processing software. In the last decade deep learning systems have been introduced for the task of image super-resolution (SR), using several convolutional layers and numerous filters. These methods have taken over the benchmarks of image quality for upscaling tasks. Would it be possible to replace classic upscalers with deep learning architectures on edge devices such as display panels, tablets, laptop computers, etc.? On one hand, the current trend in Edge-AI chips shows a promising future in this direction, with rapid development of hardware that can run deep-learning tasks efficiently. On the other hand, in image SR only few architectures have pushed the limit to extreme small sizes that can actually run on edge devices at real-time. We explore possible solutions to this problem with the aim to fill the gap between classic upscalers and small deep learning configurations. As a transition from classic to deep-learning upscaling we propose edge-SR (eSR), a set of one-layer architectures that use interpretable mechanisms to upscale images. Certainly, a one-layer architecture cannot reach the quality of deep learning systems. Nevertheless, we find that for high speed requirements, eSR becomes better at trading-off image quality and runtime performance.

However, these success stories are tainted by concerning reports on the lack of model transparency and bias against some medical conditions or patients' sub-groups. Explainable methods are considered the gateway to alleviate many of these concerns. In this study we demonstrate that the generated explanations are volatile to changes in model training that are perpendicular to the classification task and model structure. This raises further questions about trust in deep learning models for healthcare. Mainly, whether the models capture underlying causal links in the data or just rely on spurious correlations that are made visible via explanation methods. We demonstrate that the output of explainability methods on deep neural networks can vary significantly by changes of hyper-parameters, such as the random seed or how the training set is shuffled. We introduce a measure of explanation consistency which we use to highlight the identified problems on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. We find explanations of identical models but with different training setups have a low consistency: approximately 33% on average.

In this paper, we propose semantically stealthy adversarial attacks which can manipulate targeted labels as designed and preserve non-targeted labels at the same time. In this way, we may hide the corresponding attack behaviors. One challenge is making semantically meaningful manipulations across datasets/models. Another challenge is avoiding damaging non-targeted labels. To solve the above challenges, we consider each input image as prior knowledge to generate perturbations. We also design a special regularizer to help extract features. To evaluate our model's performance, we design three basic attack types, namely `vanishing into the context', `embedding fake labels', and `displacing target objects'.

However, we note that single-channel adversarial training of deep fusion is often detrimental even to robustness. Moreover, we observe cross-channel externalities, where single-channel adversarial training reduces robustness to attacks on the other channel.

A stable estimation of the THz model parameters for low SNR and shot noise configurations is essential to achieve acquisition times required for applications in, e.g., quality control. Conceptually, our deep optimization prior approach estimates the desired THz model parameters by optimizing for the weights of a neural network. While such a technique was shown to improve the reconstruction quality for convex objectives in the seminal work of Ulyanov et. al., our paper demonstrates that deep priors also allow to find better local optima in the non-convex energy landscape of the nonlinear inverse problem arising from THz imaging. We verify this claim numerically on various THz parameter estimation problems for synthetic and real data under low SNR and shot noise conditions. While the low SNR scenario not even requires regularization, the impact of shot noise is significantly reduced by total variation (TV) regularization.

As CAMs only highlight the most discriminative regions of objects, the generated pseudo labels are usually unsatisfactory to serve directly as supervision. To solve this, most existing approaches follow a multi-training pipeline to refine CAMs for better pseudo-labels, which includes: 1) re-training the classification model to generate CAMs; 2) post-processing CAMs to obtain pseudo labels; and 3) training a semantic segmentation model with the obtained pseudo labels. However, this multi-training pipeline requires complicated adjustment and additional time. To address this, we propose a class-conditional inference strategy and an activation aware mask refinement loss function to generate better pseudo labels without re-training the classifier. The class conditional inference-time approach is presented to separately and iteratively reveal the classification network's hidden object activation to generate more complete response maps. Further, our activation aware mask refinement loss function introduces a novel way to exploit saliency maps during segmentation training and refine the foreground object masks without suppressing background objects.

For road segmentation, one of the principal causes of domain shift is variation in the geometric camera parameters, which results in misregistration of scene structure between images. To address this issue, we decompose the shift into two components: Between-camera shift and within-camera shift. To handle between-camera shift, we assume that average camera parameters are known or can be estimated and use this knowledge to rectify both source and target domain images to a standard virtual camera model. To handle within-camera shift, we use estimates of road vanishing points to correct for shifts in camera pan and tilt. While this approach improves alignment, it produces gaps in the virtual image that complicates network training. To solve this problem, we introduce a novel projective image completion method that fills these gaps in a plausible way.

However, we observe that if the training data is limited, then the effectiveness of bias mitigation methods is severely degraded. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to address this problem. Specifically, we adapt self-supervision and self-distillation to reduce the impact of biases on the model in this setting. Self-supervision and self-distillation are not used for bias mitigation. However, through this work, we demonstrate for the first time that these techniques are very effective in bias mitigation. We empirically show that our approach can significantly reduce the biases learned by the model. Further, we experimentally demonstrate that our approach is complementary to other bias mitigation strategies. Our approach significantly improves their performance and further reduces the model biases in the limited data regime. Specifically, on the L-CIFAR-10S skewed dataset, our approach significantly reduces the bias score of the baseline model by 78.22% and outperforms it in terms of accuracy by a significant absolute margin of 8.89%. It also significantly reduces the bias score for the state-of-the-art domain independent bias mitigation method by 59.26% and improves its performance by a significant absolute margin of 7.08%.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Mazumder_Fair_Visual_Recognition_in_Limited_Data_Regime_Using_Self-Supervision_and_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

Rectification is a popular measure to reduce irregularities of text in images. Existing rectification methods seek to rectify text images into a strictly regular form via free parametric transformation functions. However, they always suffer from information loss or severe deformation due to their poor constraints to the transformation functions. In our investigation, we found that CNN and attention are robust to many slight irregularities. That inspires us to propose a novel and effective rectification method that mainly rectifies the principle regularities, and leaves the slight irregularities to the CNNLSTM-attention recognizer. Our rectification method first estimates the character densities and directions of the input image in a down-sampled map, then finds a best fitting curve from a small predefined Bezier curve set, and finally rectifies the input image with a transformation function corresponding to the selected curve. Transformation functions are carefully designed so that they neither lose important visual information nor cause severe deformation.

Bayesian Uncertainty and Expected Gradient Length - Regression: Two Sides of the Same Coin?,Megh Shukla," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 2367-2376","Active learning algorithms select a subset of data for annotation to maximize the model performance on a budget. One such algorithm is Expected Gradient Length, which as the name suggests uses the approximate gradient induced per example in the sampling process. While Expected Gradient Length has been successfully used for classification and regression, the formulation for regression remains intuitively driven. Hence, our theoretical contribution involves deriving this formulation, thereby supporting experimental evidence [4, 5]. Subsequently, we show that expected gradient length in regression is equivalent to Bayesian uncertainty [22]. If certain assumptions are infeasible, our algorithmic contribution (EGL++) approximates the effect of ensembles with a single deterministic network. Instead of computing multiple possible inferences per input, we leverage previously annotated samples to quantify the probability of previous labels being the true label. Such an approach allows us to extend expected gradient length to a new task: human pose estimation.

The two primary requirements of a self-driving vehicle are real-time operation and nearly 100% accuracy in constructing the 3D scene regardless of the weather conditions and the degree of ambient light. Sadly, most real-time systems as of today provide a level of accuracy that is inadequate and this endangers the life of the passengers; consequently, it is necessary to supplement such systems with expensive LiDAR-based sensors. We observe that for a given scene, different stereo matching algorithms can have vastly different accuracies, and among these algorithms, there is no clear winner. This makes the case for a hybrid stereo vision system where the best stereo vision algorithm for a stereo image pair is chosen by a predictor dynamically, in real-time. We implement such a system called PredStereo in ASIC that combines two diametrically different stereo vision algorithms, CNN-based and traditional, and chooses the best one at runtime. In addition, it associates a confidence with the chosen algorithm, such that the higher-level control system can be switched on in case of a low confidence value. We show that designing a predictor that is explainable and a system that respects soft real-time constraints is non-trivial. Hence, we propose a variety of hardware optimizations that enable our system to work in real-time. Overall, PredStereo improves the disparity estimation error over a state-of-the-art CNN-based stereo vision system by up to 18% (on average 6.25%) with a negligible area overhead (0.003 mm^2) while respecting real-time constraints.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Moolchandani_PredStereo_An_Accurate_Real-Time_Stereo_Vision_System_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
Image-Adaptive Hint Generation via Vision Transformer for Outpainting,"Daehyeon Kong, Kyeongbo Kong, Kyunghun Kim, Sung-Jun Min, Suk-Ju Kang"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 3572-3581","Image outpainting has recently received considerable attention because it can be useful in tasks such as image retargeting and panorama image generation. In general, the problem of extending an image beyond its given boundaries is still ill-posed. Conventional methods predominantly attempt image outpainting by using complex network structures. Some recent studies have tried to decrease the problem complexity through the conversion techniques from outpainting to inpainting. Although these methodologies work well in simple cases, their performance reduces considerably for asymmetrical images. This paper proposes a novel hint-based outpainting methodology that can adaptively select the most plausible patches as hints from a given image to reduce the difficulty of outpainting. To estimate high-quality hints, inspired by patch-based image inpainting methods, we utilize Vision Transformer that also considers self-attention for each patch. The estimated hints are attached on both boundaries of the input image and the inside missing regions are predicted by using an inpainting network. After finishing the prediction, the output image is obtained by removing the hints. Experiments show that our image-adaptive hint framework, when employed in representative inpainting networks, can consistently improve its performance compared to the other conversion techniques from outpainting to inpainting on SUN and Beach benchmark datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Kong_Image-Adaptive_Hint_Generation_via_Vision_Transformer_for_Outpainting_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

This paper proposes a sketch-to-image generation framework called S2FGAN, aiming to improve users' ability to interpret and flexibility of face attribute editing from a simple sketch.

A practical way to deal with the lack of annotations for the target categories is to encode not only the inputs (images) but also the outputs (object classes) into a suitable representation space. We can use these representations to measure the degree at which images and categories agree by fitting a compatibility measure using the information available during training. One way to define such a measure is by a two step process in which we first project the elements of either space visual or semantic) onto the other and then compute a similarity score in the target space. Although projections onto the visual space has shown better general performance, little attention has been paid to the degree at which the visual and semantic information contribute to the final predictions. In this paper, we build on this observation and propose two different formulations that allow us to explicitly trade-off the relative importance of the visual and semantic spaces for classification in a zero-shot setting. Our formulations are based on redefinition of the similarity scoring and loss function used to learn the projections.

However, using an object detector comes with the following downsides: 1) object detectors may not exhaustively capture all the object categories. 2) In a realistic setting, the performance may be influenced by the domain gap between the object detector and the visual-captioning dataset. To remedy this, we argue that using an external object detector could be eliminated if the model is equipped with the capability of automatically finding salient regions.

In this work, we describe how we (1) generate a dataset with over a billion images via large weakly-supervised pretraining to improve the performance of these visual representations, and (2) leverage Transformers to replace the traditional convolutional backbone, with insights into both system and performance improvements, especially at 1B+ image scale. To support this backbone model, we detail a systematic approach to deriving weakly-supervised image annotations from heterogenous text signals, demonstrating the benefits of clustering techniques to handle the long-tail distribution of image labels. Through a comprehensive study of offline and online evaluation, we show that large-scale Transformer-based pretraining provides significant benefits to industry computer vision applications. The model is deployed in a production visual shopping system, with 36% improvement in top-1 relevance and 23% improvement in click-through volume.

They are often restricted by the quality, quantity, and diversity of annotated training data and do not often generalize to out-of-domain samples. In this work, we tackle the problem of active action localization where the goal is to localize an action while controlling the geometric and physical parameters of an active camera to keep the action in the field of view without training data. We formulate an energy-based mechanism that combines predictive learning and reactive control to perform active action localization without rewards, which can be sparse or non-existent in real-world environments. We perform extensive experiments in both simulated and real-world environments on two tasks - active object tracking and active action localization.

Despite the great performance achieved by the hand-crafted and deep-learning-based methods in intra-dataset evaluations, the performance drops when dealing with unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose a dual-stream convolution neural networks (CNNs) framework. One stream adapts four learnable frequency filters to learn features in the frequency domain, which are less influenced by variations in sensors/illuminations. The other stream leverages the RGB images to complement the features of the frequency domain. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical attention module integration to join the information from the two streams at different stages by considering the nature of deep features in different layers of the CNN. The proposed method is evaluated in the intra-dataset and cross-dataset setups, and the results demonstrate that our proposed approach enhances the generalizability in most experimental setups in comparison to state-of-the-art, including the methods designed explicitly for domain adaption/shift problems.

While this problem can be mitigated by using the target domain data to align the source and target domain feature representations, the target domain data may be unavailable due to privacy concerns. Consequently, there is a need for methods that generalize well despite restricted access to target domain data during training. In this work, we propose an adversarial semantic hallucination approach (ASH), which combines a class-conditioned hallucination module and a semantic segmentation module. Since the segmentation performance varies across different classes, we design a semantic-conditioned style hallucination module to generate affine transformation parameters from semantic information in the segmentation probability maps of the source domain image. Unlike previous adaptation approaches, which treat all classes equally, ASH considers the class-wise differences. The segmentation module and the hallucination module compete adversarially, with the hallucination module generating increasingly ""difficult"" stylized images to challenge the segmentation module. In response, the segmentation module improves as it is trained with generated samples at an appropriate class-wise difficulty level.

While asking domain experts to annotate only one or a few of the cohort's images is feasible, annotating all available images is impractical. This issue is further exacerbated when pre-trained deep networks are exposed to a new image dataset from an unfamiliar distribution. Using available open-source data for ad-hoc transfer learning or hand-tuned techniques for data augmentation only provides suboptimal solutions. Motivated by atlas-based segmentation, we propose a novel volumetric self-supervised learning for data augmentation capable of synthesizing volumetric image-segmentation pairs via learning transformations from a single labeled atlas to the unlabeled data. Our work's central tenet benefits from a combined view of one-shot generative learning and the proposed self-supervised training strategy that cluster unlabeled volumetric images with similar styles together. Unlike previous methods, our method does not require input volumes at inference time to synthesize new images. Instead, it can generate diversified volumetric image-segmentation pairs from a prior distribution given a single or multi-site dataset. Augmented data generated by our method used to train the segmentation network provide significant improvements over state-of-the-art deep one-shot learning methods on the task of brain MRI segmentation.

Recent progress on the encoder-decoder model attends encoder features mainly in linear interaction with the decoder. However, growing model complexity for visual data encourages more explicit feature interaction for fine-grained information, which is currently absent in the video captioning domain. Moreover, feature aggregations methods have been used to unveil richer visual representation, either by the concatenation or using a linear layer. Though feature sets for a video semantically overlap to some extent, these approaches result in objective mismatch and feature redundancy. In addition, diversity in captions is a fundamental component of expressing one event from several meaningful perspectives, currently missing in the temporal, i.e., video captioning domain. To this end, we propose Variational Stacked Local Attention Network (VSLAN), which exploits low-rank bilinear pooling for self-attentive feature interaction and stacking multiple video feature streams in a discount fashion.

The goal is to identify the referred object. Compared to the state-of-the-art models that are mostly based on graph convolutions and LSTMs, our 3DRefTransformer net offers two key advantages. First, it is an end-to-end transformer model that operates both on language and 3D visual objects. Second, it has a natural ability to ground textual terms in the utterance to the learning representation of 3D objects in the scene. We further incorporate object pairwise spatial relation loss and contrastive learning during model training. We show in our experiments that our model improves the performance upon the current SOTA significantly on Referit3D Nr3D and Sr3D datasets.

Evaluating and Mitigating Bias in Image Classifiers: A Causal Perspective Using Counterfactuals,"Saloni Dash, Vineeth N Balasubramanian, Amit Sharma"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 915-924","Counterfactual examples for an input---perturbations that change specific features but not others---have been shown to be useful for evaluating bias of machine learning models, e.g., against specific demographic groups. However, generating counterfactual examples for images is non-trivial due to the underlying causal structure on the various features of an image. To be meaningful, generated perturbations need to satisfy constraints implied by the causal model. We present a method for generating counterfactuals by incorporating a structural causal model (SCM) in an improved variant of Adversarially Learned Inference (ALI), that generates counterfactuals in accordance with the causal relationships between attributes of an image. Based on the generated counterfactuals, we show how to explain a pre-trained machine learning classifier, evaluate its bias, and mitigate the bias using a counterfactual regularizer. On the Morpho-MNIST dataset, our method generates counterfactuals comparable in quality to prior work on SCM-based counterfactuals. Our method also works on the more complex CelebA faces dataset. Generated counterfactuals are indistinguishable from reconstructed images in a human evaluation experiment and we use them to evaluate a standard classifier trained on CelebA data. We show that the classifier is biased w.r.t. skin and hair color, and how counterfactual regularization can remove those biases.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Dash_Evaluating_and_Mitigating_Bias_in_Image_Classifiers_A_Causal_Perspective_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

We propose a novel architecture for preserving the provenance of semantic information in images to make them less susceptible to deep fake attacks. Our architecture includes semantic signing and verification steps. We apply this architecture to verifying two types of semantic information: individual identities (faces) and whether the photo was taken indoors or outdoors. Verification in both cases carefully accounts for a collection of common image transformation, such as translation, scaling, cropping, and small rotations, and rejects adversarial transformations, such as adversarially perturbed or, in the case of face verification, swapped faces. Experiments demonstrate that in the case of provenance of faces in an image, our approach is robust to black-box adversarial transformations (which are rejected) as well as benign transformations (which are accepted), with few false negatives and false positives. Background verification, on the other hand, is susceptible to black-box adversarial examples, but becomes significantly more robust after adversarial training.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Xie_PROVES_Establishing_Image_Provenance_Using_Semantic_Signatures_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

We argue that this further complicates the active learning process, since the imbalanced data pool can result in suboptimal classifiers. To address this problem in the context of active learning, we proposed a general optimization framework that explicitly takes class-balancing into account.

Recent works in this domain have mainly focused on direct manipulation of the raw RGB pixels, which only allows to perform edits involving relatively small shape changes (e.g., sleeves). The goal of our Virtual Personal Tailoring Network (VPTNet) is to extend the editing capabilities to much larger shape changes of fashion items, such as cloth length. To achieve this goal, we decouple the fashion attribute editing task into two conditional stages: shape-then-appearance editing. To this aim, we propose a shape editing network that employs a semantic parsing of the fashion image as an interface for manipulation. Compared to operating on the raw RGB image, our parsing map editing enables performing more complex shape editing operations. Second, we introduce an appearance completion network that takes the previous stage results and completes the shape difference regions to produce the final RGB image.

Building a highly accurate predictive model for these tasks usually requires a large number of manually annotated labels and pixel regions (bounding boxes) of abnormalities. However, it is expensive to acquire such annotations, especially the bounding boxes. Recently, contrastive learning has shown strong promise in leveraging unlabeled natural images to produce highly generalizable and discriminative features. However, extending its power to the medical image domain is under-explored and highly non-trivial, since medical images are much less amendable to data augmentations. In contrast, their prior knowledge, as well as radiomic features, is often crucial. To bridge this gap, we propose an end-to-end semi-supervised knowledge-augmented contrastive learning framework, that simultaneously performs disease classification and localization tasks. The key knob of our framework is a unique positive sampling approach tailored for the medical images, by seamlessly integrating radiomic features as a knowledge augmentation. Specifically, we first apply an image encoder to classify the chest X-rays and to generate the image features. We next leverage Grad-CAM to highlight the crucial (abnormal) regions for chest X-rays (even when unannotated), from which we extract radiomic features. The radiomic features are then passed through another dedicated encoder to act as the positive sample for the image features generated from the same chest X-ray. In this way, our framework constitutes a feedback loop for image and radiomic features to mutually reinforce each other. Their contrasting yields knowledge-augmented representations that are both robust and interpretable. Extensive experiments on the NIH Chest X-ray dataset demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing baselines in both classification and localization tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Han_Knowledge-Augmented_Contrastive_Learning_for_Abnormality_Classification_and_Localization_in_Chest_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

This study primarily focuses on the resizing process applied within the sketch extraction procedure, which is essential for normalizing input sketches of various sizes to the target size of the colorization model. We first analyze the inherent risk in a conventional resizing strategy, i.e., early-resizing, which places the resizing step before the line detection process to ensure the practicality. Although the strategy is extensively used, it involves an often overlooked risk of significantly degrading the generalization of the colorization model. Thus, we propose a late-resizing strategy in which resizing is applied after the line detection step. The proposed late-resizing strategy has three advantages: prevention of a quality degradation in the color image, augmentation for downsizing artifacts, and alleviation of look-ahead bias.

Towards Durability Estimation of Bioprosthetic Heart Valves via Motion Symmetry Analysis,"Maryam Alizadeh, Melissa Cote, Alexandra Branzan Albu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 3124-3133","This paper addresses bioprosthetic heart valve (BHV) durability estimation via computer vision (CV)-based analyses of the visual symmetry of valve leaflet motion. BHVs are routinely implanted in patients suffering from valvular heart diseases. Valve designs are rigorously tested using cardiovascular equipment, but once implanted, more than 50% of BHVs encounter a structural failure within 15 years. We investigate the correlation between the visual dynamic symmetry of BHV leaflets and the functional symmetry of the valves. We hypothesize that an asymmetry in the valve leaflet motion will generate an asymmetry in the flow patterns, resulting in added local stress and forces on some of the leaflets, which can accelerate the failure of the valve. We propose two different pair-wise leaflet symmetry scores based on the diagonals of orthogonal projection matrices (DOPM) and on dynamic time warping (DTW), computed from videos recorded during pulsatile flow tests.

Existing approaches exploit convolutional layers that extract image-level features learning the colourisation on the entire image, but miss entities-level ones due to pooling strategies. We believe that entity-level features are of paramount importance to deal with the intrinsic multimodality of the problem (i.e., the same object can have different colours, and the same colour can have different properties). Models based on capsule layers aim to identify entity-level features in the image from different points of view, but they do not keep track of global features. Our network architecture integrates entity-level features into the image-level features to generate a plausible image colourisation. We observed that results obtained with direct integration of such two representations are largely dominated by the image-level features, thus resulting in unsaturated colours for the entities. To limit such an issue, we propose a gradual growth of the reconstruction phase of the model while training. By advantaging of prior knowledge from each growing step, we obtain a stable collaboration between image-level and entity-level features that ultimately generates stable and vibrant colourisations.

Our SaBN factorizes the BN affine layer into one shared sandwich affine layer, cascaded by several parallel independent affine layers.

In order to make the research of new approaches possible, we first create two databases containing ""synthetic"" images of various modalities. These image modalities are rendered from a 3D terrain model and include semantic segmentations, silhouette maps and depth maps. By combining the rendered database views with existing datasets of photographs (used as ""queries"" to be localized), we create a unique benchmark for visual geo-localization in natural environments, which contains correspondences between query photographs and rendered database imagery. The distinct ability to match photographs to synthetically rendered databases defines our task as ""cross-modal"". On top of this benchmark, we provide thorough ablation studies analysing the localization potential of the database image modalities. We reveal the depth information as the best choice for outdoor localization. Finally, based on our observations, we carefully develop a fully-automatic method for large-scale cross-modal localization using image retrieval. We demonstrate its localization performance outdoors in the entire state of Switzerland. Our method reveals a large gap between operating within a single image domain (e.g. photographs) and working across domains (e.g. photographs matched to rendered images), as gained knowledge is not transferable between the two.

Since we only have very limited training samples, one of the key challenges lies in how to address (dis)occlusions, e.g. when a hand moves behind or in front of a body. To address this, we introduce a novel layering approach which explicitly splits the input keypoints into different layers which are processed independently. These layers represent different parts of the character and provide a strong implicit bias that helps to obtain realistic results even with strong (dis)occlusions. To combine the features of individual layers we use an adaptive scaling approach conditioned on all keypoints. Finally, we introduce a mask connectivity constraint to reduce distortion artifacts that occur with extreme out-of-distribution poses at test time. We show that our approach outperforms recent baselines and creates realistic animations for diverse characters.

Kitani"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 1220-1230","The goal of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) is to estimate the perceptual image quality in accordance with subjective evaluations, it is a complex and unsolved problem due to the absence of the pristine reference image. In this paper, we propose a novel model to address the NR-IQA task by leveraging a hybrid approach that benefits from Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and self-attention mechanism in Transformers to extract both local and non-local features from the input image. We capture local structure information of the image via CNNs, then to circumvent the locality bias among the extracted CNNs features and obtain a non-local representation of the image, we utilize Transformers on the extracted features where we model them as a sequential input to the Transformer model. Furthermore, to improve the monotonicity correlation between the subjective and objective scores, we utilize the relative distance information among the images within each batch and enforce the relative ranking among them. Last but not least, we observe that the performance of NR-IQA models degrades when we apply equivariant transformations (e.g. horizontal flipping) to the inputs. Therefore, we propose a method that leverages self-consistency as a source of self-supervision to improve the robustness of NR-IQA models. Specifically, we enforce self-consistency between the outputs of our quality assessment model for each image and its transformation (horizontally flipped) to utilize the rich self-supervisory information and reduce the uncertainty of the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our work, we evaluate it on seven standard IQA datasets (both synthetic and authentic) and show that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on various datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Golestaneh_No-Reference_Image_Quality_Assessment_via_Transformers_Relative_Ranking_and_Self-Consistency_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

This paper presents a new deep periocular recognition framework called attribute-based deep periocular recognition (ADPR), which predicts soft biometrics and incorporates the prediction into a periocular recognition algorithm to determine identity from periocular images with high accuracy. We propose an end-to-end framework, which uses several shared convolutional neural network (CNN) layers (a common network) whose output feeds two separate dedicated branches (modality dedicated layers); the first branch classifies periocular images while the second branch predicts soft biometrics. Next, the features from these two branches are fused together for a final periocular recognition. The proposed method is different from existing methods as it not only uses a shared CNN feature space to train these two tasks jointly, but it also fuses predicted soft biometric features with the periocular features in the training step to improve the overall periocular recognition performance.

Coupled Training for Multi-Source Domain Adaptation,"Ohad Amosy, Gal Chechik"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 420-429","Unsupervised domain adaptation is often addressed by learning a joint representation of labeled samples from a source domain and unlabeled samples from a target domain. Unfortunately, hard sharing of representation may hurt adaptation because of negative transfer, where features that are useful for source domains are learned even if they hurt inference on the target domain. Here, we propose an alternative, soft sharing scheme. We train separate but weakly-coupled models for the source and the target data, while encouraging their predictions to agree. Training the two coupled models jointly effectively exploits the distribution over unlabeled target data and achieves high accuracy on the target. Specifically, we show analytically and empirically that the decision boundaries of the target model converge to low-density ""valleys"" of the target distribution.

Successful DML models often require strong local and global representations, however, effective integration of local and global features in DML model training is a challenge. DML models are often trained with specific loss functions, including pairwise-based and proxy-based losses. The pairwise-based loss functions leverage rich semantic relations among data points, however, they often suffer from slow convergence during DML model training. On the other hand, the proxy-based loss functions often lead to significant speedups in convergence during training, while the rich relations among data points are often not fully explored by the proxy-based losses.

During training, the novelty class is absent, preventing the use of traditional classification approaches. Deep autoencoders have been widely used as a base of many novelty detection methods. In particular, context autoencoders have been successful in the novelty detection task because of the more effective representations they learn by reconstructing original images from randomly masked images. However, a significant drawback of context autoencoders is that random masking fails to consistently cover important structures of the input image, leading to suboptimal representations - especially for the novelty detection task. In this paper, to optimize input masking, we introduce a Mask Module that learns to generate optimal masks and a Reconstructor that aims to reconstruct masked images. The networks are trained in an adversarial setting in which the Mask Module seeks to maximize the reconstruction error that the Reconstructor is minimizing. When applied to novelty detection, the proposed approach learns semantically richer representations compared to context autoencoders and enhances novelty detection at test time through more optimal masking. Novelty detection experiments on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 image datasets demonstrate the proposed approach's superiority over cutting-edge methods.

Experimental results confirm that the inclusion of point-cloud feature extractors increases recall for dim objects in the high-background regime.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Salvatore_Learned_Event-Based_Visual_Perception_for_Improved_Space_Object_Detection_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

Above-ground biomass (AGB) is a key trait relevant to breeding, agronomy and crop physiology field experiments. However, measuring the biomass of a cereal plot requires cutting, drying and weighing processes, which are laborious, expensive and destructive tasks. This paper proposes a non-destructive and high-throughput method to predict biomass from field samples based on Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). Unlike previous methods that are based on the density of a point cloud or plant height, our biomass prediction network (BioNet) additionally considers plant structure. Our BioNet contains three modules: 1) a completion module to predict missing points due to canopy occlusion; 2) a regularization module to regularize the neural representation of the whole plot; and 3) a projection module to learn the salient structures from a bird's eye view of the point cloud. An attention-based fusion block is used to achieve final biomass predictions. In addition, the complete dataset, including hand-measured biomass and LiDAR data, is made available to the community. Experiments show that our BioNet achieves approximately 33% improvement over current state-of-the-art methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Pan_Biomass_Prediction_With_3D_Point_Clouds_From_LiDAR_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

More recently, MLP-mixer abandons both the convolution and the self-attention operation, proposing an architecture containing only MLP layers. To achieve cross-patch communications, it devises an additional token-mixing MLP besides the channel-mixing MLP. It achieves promising results when training on an extremely large-scale dataset such as JFT-300M. But it cannot achieve as outstanding performance as its CNN and ViT counterparts when training on medium-scale datasets such as ImageNet-1K and ImageNet-21K. The performance drop of MLP-mixer motivates us to rethink the token-mixing MLP. We discover that token-mixing operation in MLP-mixer is a variant of depthwise convolution with a global reception field and spatial-specific configuration. It is the global reception field and the spatial-specific property that make token-mixing MLP prone to over-fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel pure MLP architecture, spatial-shift MLP (S^2-MLP). Different from MLP-mixer, our S^2-MLP only contains channel-mixing MLP. We devise a spatial-shift operation for achieving the communication between patches. It has a local reception field and is spatial-agnostic. Meanwhile, it is parameter-free and efficient for computation. The proposed S^2-MLP attains higher recognition accuracy than MLP-mixer when training on ImageNet-1K dataset.

While these priors can provide facial geometric cues effectively, they are insufficient to contain local texture details that act as important clues to solve face deblurring problem. To deal with this, we focus on estimating the deep features of pre-trained face recognition networks (e.g., VGGFace network) that include rich information about sharp faces as a prior, and adopt a generative adversarial network (GAN) to learn it. To this end, we propose a deep feature prior guided network (DFPGnet) that restores facial details using the estimated the deep feature prior from a blurred image. In our DFPGnet, the generator is divided into two streams including prior estimation and deblurring streams. Since the estimated deep features of the prior estimation stream are learned from the VGGFace network which is trained for face recognition not for deblurring, we need to alleviate the discrepancy of feature distributions between the two streams. Therefore, we present feature transform modules at the connecting points of the two streams. In addition, we propose a channel-attention feature discriminator and prior loss, which encourages the generator to focus on more important channels for deblurring among the deep feature prior during training.

However, full-scale deep neural networks are often too resource-intensive in terms of energy and storage. As a result, the bulk part of the machine learning operation is therefore often carried out on an edge server, where the data is compressed and transmitted. However, compressing data (such as images) leads to transmitting information irrelevant to the supervised task. Another popular approach is to split the deep network between the device and the server while compressing intermediate features. To date, however, such split computing strategies have barely outperformed the aforementioned naive data compression baselines due to their inefficient approaches to feature compression. This paper adopts ideas from knowledge distillation and neural image compression to compress intermediate feature representations more efficiently. Our supervised compression approach uses a teacher model and a student model with a stochastic bottleneck and learnable prior for entropy coding (Entropic Student). We compare our approach to various neural image and feature compression baselines in three vision tasks and found that it achieves better supervised rate-distortion performance while maintaining smaller end-to-end latency.

It requires the synthesis of a sequence of realistic frames with temporal coherency. Besides, transferring the different actions to a novel target view requires awareness of action category and viewpoint change simultaneously. To address these challenges we propose a novel framework named Pose-guided Action Separable Generative Adversarial Net (PAS-GAN), which utilizes pose to alleviate the difficulty of this task. First, we propose a recurrent pose-transformation module which transforms actions from the source view to the target view and generates novel view pose sequence in 2D coordinate space. Second, a well-transformed pose sequence enables us to separatethe action and background in the target view. We employ a novel local-global spatial transformation module to effectively generate sequential video features in the target view using these action and background features. Finally, the generated video features are used to synthesize human action with the help of a 3D decoder. Moreover, to focus on dynamic action in the video, we propose a novel multi-scale action-separable loss which further improves the video quality.

We present an action anticipation model that uses goal information in an effective manner. Specifically, we use a latent goal representation as a proxy for the ""real goal"" of the sequence and use this goal information when predicting the next action. We design a model to compute the latent goal representation from the observed video and use it to predict the next action. We also exploit two properties of goals to propose new losses for training the model. First, the effect of the next action should be closer to the latent goal than the observed action, termed as ""goal closeness"". Second, the latent goal should remain consistent before and after the execution of the next action which we coined as ""goal consistency"". Using this technique, we obtain state-of-the-art action anticipation performance on scripted datasets 50Salads and Breakfast that have predefined goals in all their videos. We also evaluate the latent goal-based model on EPIC-KITCHENS55 which is an unscripted dataset with multiple goals being pursued simultaneously.

In a real-world scenario instead, like autonomous driving, more attention should be devoted to real-world adversarial examples (RWAEs), which are physical objects (e.g., billboards and printable patches) optimized to be adversarial to the entire perception pipeline. This paper presents an in-depth evaluation of the robustness of popular SS models by testing the effects of both digital and real-world adversarial patches. These patches are crafted with powerful attacks enriched with a novel loss function. Firstly, an investigation on the Cityscapes dataset is conducted by extending the Expectation Over Transformation (EOT) paradigm to cope with SS. Then, a novel attack optimization, called scene-specific attack, is proposed. Such an attack leverages the CARLA driving simulator to improve the transferability of the proposed EOT-based attack to a real 3D environment. Finally, a printed physical billboard containing an adversarial patch was tested in an outdoor driving scenario to assess the feasibility of the studied attacks in the real world. Exhaustive experiments revealed that the proposed attack formulations outperform previous work to craft both digital and real-world adversarial patches for SS.

To enable a more efficient transfer of pretrained knowledge under relaxed conditions, we propose a simple yet powerful knowledge transfer methodology without any restrictions regarding the network structure or dataset used, namely self-supervised knowledge transfer (SSKT), via loosely supervised auxiliary tasks. For this, we devise a training methodology that transfers previously learned knowledge to the current training process as an auxiliary task for the target task through self-supervision using a soft label. The SSKT is independent of the network structure and dataset, and is trained differently from existing knowledge transfer methods; hence, it has an advantage in that the prior knowledge acquired from various tasks can be naturally transferred during the training process to the target task. Furthermore, it can improve the generalization performance on most datasets through the proposed knowledge transfer between different problem domains from multiple source networks.

These keywords are then subsequently used to aid the later creation of medical reports for a patient. Since these keywords commonly exist and are useful for generating medical reports, we incorporate them into automatic report generation.

Therefore, in this paper, the unique characteristics of the signing poses of sign languages is utilized to formulate hierarchical spatio-temporal graph representations of signing poses, including both high-level and fine-level graphs of which each vertex characterizes a specified body part and the edges represent the interactions between any two vertices. Specifically, high-level graphs represent the interactions between key regions such as hands and face, and fine-level graphs represent relationships between the joints of each hand and landmarks of facial regions. To this end, a novel deep learning architecture, namely hierarchical spatio-temporal graph neural network (HST-GNN), is proposed to learn such graph representations. In addition, graph convolutions and graph self-attentions with neighborhood context are proposed to characterize both the local and the global graph properties. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrated the the performance.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Kan_Sign_Language_Translation_With_Hierarchical_Spatio-Temporal_Graph_Neural_Network_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

We present a new model for joint-based action recognition, which first extracts motion features from each joint separately through a shared motion encoder before performing collective reasoning. Our joint selector module re-weights the joint information to select the most discriminative joints for the task. We also propose a novel joint-contrastive loss that pulls together groups of joint features which convey the same action. We strengthen the joint-based representations by using a geometry-aware data augmentation technique which jitters pose heatmaps while retaining the dynamics of the action. We show large improvements over the current state-of-the-art joint-based approaches on JHMDB, HMDB, Charades, AVA action recognition datasets.

The importance of facial expressions in inter-person communication is known. Consequently, it is important to develop methods that can detect and localize manipulations in facial expressions. To this end, we present a novel framework to exploit the underlying feature representations of facial expressions learned from expression recognition models to identify the manipulated features.

It leverages that RF signals traverse walls and occlusions to deliver through-wall pose estimation, action recognition, scene captioning, and human re-identification. However, unlike RGB datasets which can be labeled by human workers, labeling RF signals is a daunting task because such signals are not human interpretable. Yet, it is fairly easy to collect unlabelled RF signals. It would be highly beneficial to use such unlabeled RF data to learn useful representations in an unsupervised manner. Thus, in this paper, we explore the feasibility of adapting RGB-based unsupervised representation learning to RF signals. We show that while contrastive learning has emerged as the main technique for unsupervised representation learning from images and videos, such methods produce poor performance when applied to sensing humans using RF signals.

The goal is to align an arbitrary dimensional time series with its ground truth as accurately as possible while reducing the error in the prediction with a distance loss and the variance with a similarity loss.

This has led to the creation of multiple algorithms that endeavor to mitigate bias. However, it is not clear how effective these methods are. This is because study protocols differ among papers, systems are tested on datasets that fail to test many forms of bias, and systems have access to hidden knowledge or are tuned specifically to the test set. To address this, we introduce an improved evaluation protocol, sensible metrics, and a new dataset, which enables us to ask and answer critical questions about bias mitigation algorithms. We evaluate seven state-of-the-art algorithms using the same network architecture and hyperparameter selection policy across three benchmark datasets. We introduce a new dataset called BiasedMNIST that enables the assessment of robustness to multiple bias sources. We use BiasedMNIST and a visual question answering (VQA) benchmark to assess robustness to hidden biases. Rather than only tuning to the test set distribution, we study robustness across different tuning distributions, which is critical because for many applications the test distribution may not be known during development. We find that algorithms exploit hidden biases, are unable to scale to multiple forms of bias, and are highly sensitive to the choice of tuning set.

Such an assumption may not hold in practice, as source data is often inaccessible (e.g., due to privacy reasons). On the contrary, a pre-trained source model is usually available, which performs poorly on target due to the well-known domain shift problem. This translates into a significant amount of misclassifications, which can be interpreted as structured noise affecting the inferred target pseudo-labels. In this work, we cast UDA as a pseudo-label refinery problem in the challenging source-free scenario. We propose Negative Ensemble Learning (NEL) technique, a unified method for adaptive noise filtering and progressive pseudo-label refinement. NEL is devised to tackle noisy pseudo-labels by enhancing diversity in ensemble members with different stochastic (i) input augmentation and (ii) feedback. The latter is achieved by leveraging the novel concept of Disjoint Residual Labels, which allow propagating diverse information to the different members. Eventually, a single model is trained with the refined pseudo-labels, which leads to a robust performance on the target domain.

However, we find that these methods fail to remove the rain streaks when applied for image deraining tasks. The method's poor performance is due to the explicit assumptions: (i) the distribution of noise or haze is uniform and (ii) the value of a noisy or hazy pixel is independent of its neighbors. The rainy pixels are non-uniformly distributed, and it is not necessarily dependant on its neighboring pixels. Hence, we conclude that the self-supervised method needs to have some prior knowledge about rain distribution to perform the deraining task. To provide this knowledge, we hypothesize a network trained with minimal supervision to estimate the likelihood of rainy pixels. This leads us to our proposed method called FLUID: Few Shot Self-Supervised Image Deraining.

In this paper, we introduce a real-time method that is a significant step towards enabling touch typing on arbitrary flat surfaces (e.g., tables). The method employs only a simple video camera, placed in front of the user on the flat surface --- at an angle practical for mobile usage. To achieve this, we adopt a classification framework, based on the observation that, in touch typing, similar hand configurations imply the same typed character across users. Importantly, this approach allows the convenience of un-calibrated typing, where the hand positions, with respect to the camera and each other, are not dictated. To improve accuracy, we propose a Language Processing scheme, which corrects the typed text and is specifically designed for real-time performance and integration with the vision-based signal.

The proposed evaluation protocol enables testing the ability to improve classification using metadata - e.g. precise geographic location, habitat, and substrate, facilitates classifier calibration testing, and finally allows to study the impact of the device settings on the classification performance. Experiments using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the recent Vision Transformers (ViT) show that DF20 presents a challenging task. Interestingly, ViT achieves results superior to CNN baselines with 80.45% accuracy and 0.743 macro F1 score, reducing the CNN error by 9% and 12% respectively. A simple procedure for including metadata into the decision process improves the classification accuracy by more than 2.95 percentage points, reducing the error rate by 15%.

Single Image Deraining Network With Rain Embedding Consistency and Layered LSTM,"Yizhou Li, Yusuke Monno, Masatoshi Okutomi"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 4060-4069","Single image deraining is typically addressed as residual learning to predict the rain layer from an input rainy image. For this purpose, an encoder-decoder network draws wide attention, where the encoder is required to encode a high-quality rain embedding which determines the performance of the subsequent decoding stage to reconstruct the rain layer. However, most of existing studies ignore the significance of rain embedding quality, thus leading to limited performance with over/under-deraining. In this paper, with our observation of the high rain layer reconstruction performance by an rain-to-rain autoencoder, we introduce the idea of ""Rain Embedding Consistency"" by regarding the encoded embedding by the autoencoder as an ideal rain embedding and aim at enhancing the deraining performance by improving the consistency between the ideal rain embedding and the rain embedding derived by the encoder of the deraining network. To achieve this, a Rain Embedding Loss is applied to directly supervise the encoding process, with a Rectified Local Contrast Normalization (RLCN) as the guide that effectively extracts the candidate rain pixels. We also propose Layered LSTM for recurrent deraining and fine-grained encoder feature refinement considering different scales. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods particularly on a real-world dataset.

The resulting problem is an optimization problem on manifolds, and we propose a variant of Riemannian conjugate gradients to solve it.

In many cases, however, the trained models cannot be manipulated and must be treated as ""black-boxes"". In this paper, we present six different saliency maps that can be used to explain any face verification algorithm with no manipulation inside of the face recognition model. The key idea of the methods is based on how the matching score of the two face images changes when the probe is perturbed. The proposed methods remove and aggregate different parts of the face, and measure contributions of these parts individually and in-collaboration as well. We test and compare our proposed methods in three different scenarios: synthetic images with different qualities and occlusions, real face images with different facial expressions, poses, and occlusions and faces from different demographic groups. In our experiments, five different face verification algorithms are used: ArcFace, Dlib, FaceNet (trained on VGGface2 and Casia-WebFace), and LBP. We conclude that one of the proposed methods achieves saliency maps that are stable and interpretable to humans. In addition, our method, in combination with a new visualization of saliency maps based on contours, shows promising results in comparison with other state-of-the-art art methods.

These biases makes it easier for a model to overfit by relying on spurious correlations or naive data patterns. We propose a systematic framework to address these biases through three Control-Knobs that enable us to generate a test bed of datasets of progressive difficulty levels.

We perform a detailed evaluation of these models with different language and visual features on our benchmark. We observe a consistent improvement with HTRN over SOTA ( 18% in Visual Cloze task and 13% in average over all the tasks). We also observe a drop in performance across all the models when testing on RecipeQA and proposed Meta-RecipeQA (e.g. 83.6% versus 67.1% for HTRN), which shows that the proposed dataset is relatively less biased.

Horses express pain through their facial and body behavior, but may hide signs of pain from unfamiliar human observers. In addition, collecting visual data with detailed annotation of horse behavior and pain state is both cumbersome and not scalable. Consequently, a pragmatic equine pain classification system would use video of the unobserved horse and weak labels. This paper proposes such a method for equine pain classification by using multi-view surveillance video footage of unobserved horses with induced orthopaedic pain, with temporally sparse video level pain labels. To ensure that pain is learned from horse body language alone, we first train a self-supervised generative model to disentangle horse pose from its appearance and background before using the disentangled horse pose latent representation for pain classification. To make best use of the pain labels, we develop a novel loss that formulates pain classification as a multi-instance learning problem. Our method achieves pain classification accuracy better than human expert performance with 60% accuracy. The learned latent horse pose representation is shown to be viewpoint covariant, and disentangled from horse appearance. Qualitative analysis of pain classified segments shows correspondence between the pain symptoms identified by our model, and equine pain scales used in veterinary practice.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Rashid_Equine_Pain_Behavior_Classification_via_Self-Supervised_Disentangled_Pose_Representation_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

As annotated objects exist in the target domain, instance level alignment can be utilized to improve the performance. Traditional methods conduct the instance level alignment by semantically aligning the distributions of paired object features with domain adversarial training. Although it is demonstrated that point-wise surrogates of distribution alignment provide a more effective solution in few-shot classification tasks across domains, this point-wise alignment approach has not yet been extended to object detection. In this work, we propose a method that extends the point-wise alignment from classification to object detection. Moreover, in the few-shot loose annotation setting, the background ROIs of target domain suffer from severe label noise problem, which may make the point-wise alignment fail. To this end, we exploit moving average centroids to mitigate the label noise problem of background ROIs. Meanwhile, we exploit point-wise alignment over instances and centroids to tackle the problem of scarcity of labeled target instances. Hence this method is not only robust against label noises of background ROIs but also robust against the scarcity of labeled target objects.

By having to implicitly account for geometric and photometric variations in facial shape and appearance, such approaches result in unrealistic completions, especially under large variations in pose, shape, illumination and mask sizes. To alleviate these limitations, we introduce 3DFaceFill, an analysis-by-synthesis approach for face completion that explicitly considers the image formation process. It comprises three components, (1) an encoder that disentangles the face into its constituent 3D mesh, 3D pose, illumination and albedo factors, (2) an autoencoder that inpaints the UV representation of facial albedo, and (3) a renderer that resynthesizes the completed face. By operating on the UV representation, 3DFaceFill affords the power of correspondence and allows us to naturally enforce geometrical priors (e.g. facial symmetry) more effectively. Quantitatively, 3DFaceFill improves the state-of-the-art by up to 4dB higher PSNR and 25% better LPIPS for large masks. And, qualitatively, it leads to demonstrably more photorealistic face completions over a range of masks and occlusions while preserving consistency in global and component-wise shape, pose, illumination and eye-gaze.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Dey_3DFaceFill_An_Analysis-by-Synthesis_Approach_To_Face_Completion_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

Unlike recent appearance transferring methods, our approach can reconstruct a fully controllable 3D texture-mapped model of a person, while taking into account the manifold structure from body shape and texture appearance in the view synthesis. Specifically, our approach models mesh deformations with a three-stage GCN trained in a self-supervised manner on rendered silhouettes of the human body.

Unlike labeling for image classification, this problem is not well defined due to the object's bounding box. In this paper, we investigate the problem from a perspective of distillation, hence we call Label Assignment Distillation (LAD). Our initial motivation is very simple, we use a teacher network to generate labels for the student. This can be achieved in two ways: either using the teacher's prediction as the direct targets (soft label), or through the hard labels dynamically assigned by the teacher (LAD). Our experiments reveal that: (i) LAD is more effective than soft-label, but they are complementary. (ii) Using LAD, a smaller teacher can also improve a larger student significantly, while soft-label can't. We then introduce Co-learning LAD, in which two networks simultaneously learn from scratch and the role of teacher and student are dynamically interchanged.

However, DNNs are vulnerable towards adversarial examples, and it is expected that this weakness also plagues DNNs for aerial imagery. In this work, we demonstrate one of the first efforts on physical adversarial attacks on aerial imagery, whereby adversarial patches were optimised, fabricated and installed on or near target objects (cars) to significantly reduce the efficacy of an object detector applied on overhead images. Physical adversarial attacks on aerial images, particularly those captured from satellite platforms, are challenged by atmospheric factors (lighting, weather, seasons) and the distance between the observer and target. To investigate the effects of these challenges, we devised novel experiments and metrics to evaluate the efficacy of physical adversarial attacks against object detectors in aerial scenes.

On low SNR images such as biological electron microscopy (EM) data, however, the performance of these algorithms is significantly lower. Moreover, biological data typically lacks standardized annotations further complicating the training of detection algorithms. Accurate identification of proteins from EM images is a critical task, as the detected positions serve as inputs for the downstream 3D structure determination process. To overcome the low SNR and lack of image annotations, we propose a joint weakly-supervised learning framework that performs image denoising while detecting objects of interest. By leveraging per-pixel soft segmentation and consistency regularization, our framework denoises images without the need of clean images and is able to detect particles of interest even when less than 0.5% of the data are labeled. We validate our approach on real single-particle cryo-EM and cryo-electron tomography (ET) images which are known to suffer from extremely low SNR, and show that our strategy outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SofA) methods used in the cryo-EM field by a significant margin.

We address this drawback of current pre-training methods, which fail to exploit the rich cues in spoken language.

Current place recognition approaches lack the ability to go beyond objects that are available in the image and hence miss out on understanding the scene completely. In this paper, we take a step towards holistic scene understanding. We address the problem of image geo-localization by retrieving corresponding aerial views from a large database of geotagged aerial imagery. One of the main challenges in tackling this problem is the limited Field of View (FoV) nature of query images which needs to be matched to aerial views which contain 360degFoV details. State-of-the-art method DSM-Net [17] tackles this challenge by matching aerial images locally within fixed FoV sectors. We show that local matching limits complete scene understanding and is inadequate when partial buildings are visible in query images or when local sectors of aerial images are covered by dense trees. Our approach considers both local and global properties of aerial images and hence is robust to such conditions. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed approach improves top-1% image recall rate on the CVACT [9] data-set from 57.08% to 77.19% and from 61.20% to 75.21% on the CVUSA [25] data-set for 70degFoV.

In computer vision, on top of the standard image processing functions, data augmentation techniques based on regional dropout such as CutOut, MixUp, and CutMix and policy-based selection such as AutoAugment demonstrated state-of-the-art (SOTA) results. With an increasing number of data augmentation algorithms being proposed, the focus is always on optimizing the input-output mapping while not realizing that there might be an untapped value in the transformed images with the same label. We hypothesize that by forcing the representations of two transformations to agree, we can further reduce the model generalization error.

An AV must drive safely towards its destination, avoiding obstacles, and respond quickly when the vehicle must stop. Any transient errors in software calculations or hardware memory in these deepnet applications can potentially lead to dramatically incorrect results. Therefore, assessing and mitigating any transient errors and providing robust results are important for safety-critical systems. Previous research on this subject focused on detecting errors and then recovering from the errors by re-running the network. Other approaches were based on the extent of full network duplication such as the ensemble learning-based approach to boost system fault-tolerance by leveraging each model's advantages. However, it is hard to detect errors in a deep neural network, and the computational overhead of full redundancy can be substantial. We first study the impact of the error types and locations in deepnets. We next focus on selecting which part should be duplicated using multiple ranking methods to measure the order of importance among neurons. We find that the duplication overhead for computation and memory is a trade-off between algorithmic performance and robustness. To achieve higher robustness with less system overhead, we present two error protection mechanisms that only duplicate parts of the network from critical neurons. Finally, we substantiate the practical feasibility of our approach and evaluate the improvement in the accuracy of a deepnet in the presence of errors.

We train the pruning and distillation processes simultaneously on a well-known GAN architecture in an end-to-end manner. After training, all redundant parameters as well as the mask layers are discarded, yielding a lighter network while retaining the performance.

Accurate detection of table cells (including empty cells) simplifies structure extraction and hence, it becomes the prime focus of our work. We propose a novel object-detection-based deep model that captures the inherent alignments of cells within tables and is fine-tuned for fast optimization. Despite accurate detection of cells, recognizing structures for dense tables may still be challenging because of difficulties in capturing long-range row/column dependencies in presence of multi-row/column spanning cells.

During MI, the trained model under attack (MUA) is usually frozen and used to guide the training of a generator, such as a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), to reconstruct the distribution prior of that model. This might cause leakage of original training samples, and if successful, the privacy of dataset subjects will be at risk if the training data contains Personally Identifiable Information (PII). Therefore, an in-depth investigation of the potentials of MI techniques is crucial for the development of corresponding defense techniques. High-quality reconstruction of training data based on a single model is challenging. However, existing MI literature does not explore targeting multiple trained models simultaneously, which may provide additional information and diverse perspectives to the adversary. In this work, we propose the ensemble inversion technique that estimates the distribution of original training data, by training a generator constrained by an ensemble (or set) of trained models with shared subjects or entities. This technique leads to noticeable improvements of the quality of the generated samples with distinguishable features of the dataset entities compared to MI of a single model. We utilize an auxiliary dataset that's similar to the presumed training data, but we also demonstrate high quality data-free model inversion without such dataset.

In this paper, we propose a simple but powerful self-attention mechanism optimized for lane detection called the Expanded Self Attention (ESA) module. Inspired by the simple geometric structure of lanes, the proposed method predicts the confidence of a lane along the vertical and horizontal directions in an image. The prediction of the confidence enables estimating occluded locations by extracting global contextual information. ESA module can be easily implemented and applied to any encoder-decoder-based model without increasing the inference time. The performance of our method is evaluated on three popular lane detection benchmarks (TuSimple, CULane and BDD100K). We achieve state-of-the-art performance in CULane and BDD100K and distinct improvement on TuSimple dataset. The experimental results show that our approach is robust to occlusion and extreme lighting conditions.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Lee_Robust_Lane_Detection_via_Expanded_Self_Attention_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
Preventing Catastrophic Forgetting and Distribution Mismatch in Knowledge Distillation via Synthetic Data,"Kuluhan Binici, Nam Trung Pham, Tulika Mitra, Karianto Leman"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 663-671","With the increasing popularity of deep learning on edge devices, compressing large neural networks to meet the hardware requirements of resource-constrained devices became a significant research direction. Numerous compression methodologies are currently being used to reduce the memory sizes and energy consumption of neural networks. Knowledge distillation (KD) is among such methodologies and it functions by using data samples to transfer the knowledge captured by a large model (teacher) to a smaller one (student). However, due to various reasons, the original training data might not be accessible at the compression stage. Therefore, data-free model compression is an ongoing research problem that has been addressed by various works. In this paper, we point out that catastrophic forgetting is a problem that can potentially be observed in existing data-free distillation methods. Moreover, the sample generation strategies in some of these methods could result in a mismatch between the synthetic and real data distributions. To prevent such problems, we propose a data-free KD framework that maintains a dynamic collection of generated samples over time. Additionally, we add the constraint of matching the real data distribution in sample generation strategies that target maximum information gain. Our experiments demonstrate that we can improve the accuracy of the student models obtained via KD when compared with state-of-the-art approaches on the SVHN, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR100 datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Binici_Preventing_Catastrophic_Forgetting_and_Distribution_Mismatch_in_Knowledge_Distillation_via_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv

To date, all proposed approaches rely on human expertise to manually adapt a given UDA method (e.g. DANN) to a specific backbone architecture (e.g. ResNet). This dependency on handcrafted designs limits the applicability of a given approach in time, as old methods need to be constantly adapted to novel backbones. Existing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approaches cannot be directly applied to mitigate this issue, as they rely on labels that are not available in the UDA setting. Furthermore, most NAS methods search for full architectures, which precludes the use of pre-trained models, essential in a vast range of UDA settings for reaching SOTA results.

Given two nearby video frames, perceptual consistency measures how much the segmentation decisions agree with the pixel correspondences obtained via matching general perceptual features. More specifically, for each pixel in one frame, we find the most perceptually correlated pixel in the other frame. Our intuition is that such a pair of pixels are highly likely to belong to the same class. Next, we assess how much the segmentation agrees with such perceptual correspondences, based on which we derive the perceptual consistency of the segmentation maps across these two frames. Utilizing perceptual consistency, we can evaluate the temporal consistency of video segmentation by measuring the perceptual consistency over consecutive pairs of segmentation maps in a video. Furthermore, given a sparsely labeled test video, perceptual consistency can be utilized to aid with predicting the pixel-wise correctness of the segmentation on an unlabeled frame. More specifically, by measuring the perceptual consistency between the predicted segmentation and the available ground truth on a nearby frame and combining it with the segmentation confidence, we can accurately assess the classification correctness on each pixel. Our experiments show that the proposed perceptual consistency can more accurately evaluate the temporal consistency of video segmentation as compared to flow-based measures. Furthermore, it can help more confidently predict segmentation accuracy on unlabeled test frames, as compared to using classification confidence alone.

Active Learning for Improved Semi-Supervised Semantic Segmentation in Satellite Images,"Shasvat Desai, Debasmita Ghose"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 553-563","Remote sensing data is crucial for applications ranging from monitoring forest fires and deforestation to tracking urbanization. Most of these tasks require dense pixel-level annotations for the model to parse visual information from limited labeled data available for these satellite images. Due to the dearth of high-quality labeled training data in this domain, there is a need to focus on semi-supervised techniques. These techniques generate pseudo-labels from a small set of labeled examples which are used to augment the labeled training set. This makes it necessary to have a highly representative and diverse labeled training set. Therefore, we propose to use an active learning-based sampling strategy to select a highly representative set of labeled training data. We demonstrate our proposed method's effectiveness on two existing semantic segmentation datasets containing satellite images: UC Merced Land Use Classification Dataset and DeepGlobe Land Cover Classification Dataset.

In this paper, we discuss the problem of summarizing videos recorded independently by several dynamic cameras that intermittently share the field of view. We present a robust framework that (a) identifies a diverse set of important events among moving cameras that often are not capturing the same scene, and (b) selects the most representative view(s) at each event to be included in a universal summary. Due to the lack of an applicable alternative, we collected a new multi-view egocentric dataset, Multi-Ego. Our dataset is recorded simultaneously by three cameras, covering a wide variety of real-life scenarios. The footage is annotated by multiple individuals under various summarization configurations, with a consensus analysis ensuring a reliable ground truth. We conduct extensive experiments on the compiled dataset in addition to three other standard benchmarks that show the robustness and the advantage of our approach in both supervised and unsupervised settings.

In this paper, we propose an efficient low displacement rank (LDR) regularization strategy termed Ortho-Shot; a technique that imposes orthogonal regularization on the convolutional layers of a few-shot classifier, which is based on the doubly-block toeplitz (DBT) matrix structure. The regularized convolutional layers of the few-shot classifier enhances model generalization and intra-class feature embeddings that are crucial for few-shot learning. Overfitting is a typical issue for few-shot models, the lack of data diversity inhibits proper model inference which weakens the classification accuracy of few-shot learners to novel classes.

The VAS task inevitably relies on pre-defined action labels and is thus hard to scale to various open-domain videos. To overcome this limitation, the VPS task tries to divide a video into several category-independent procedure segments. However, the existing dataset for the VPS task is small (2k videos) and lacks diversity (only cooking domain). To tackle these problems, we collect a large and diverse dataset called TIPS, specifically for the VPS task.

Such attacks are carefully crafted imperceptible noises that can fool the network and can cause severe consequences when deployed. To encounter them, the model requires training data for adversarial training or explicit regularization-based techniques. However, privacy has become an important concern, restricting access to only trained models but not the training data (e.g. biometric data). Also, data curation is expensive and companies may have proprietary rights over it. To handle such situations, we propose a completely novel problem of ""test-time adversarial defense in absence of training data and even their statistics"". We solve it in two stages: a) detection and b) correction of adversarial samples. Our adversarial sample detection framework is initially trained on arbitrary data and is subsequently adapted to the unlabelled test data through unsupervised domain adaptation.

Hence, to attain the adaptive multi-modal fusion, we propose a leaky gated cross-attention mechanism. In our work, we take the multi-stage cross-attention as the baseline fusion module to obtain multi-modal features. Then, for the stages of each modality, we design gates to decide the dependency on the other modality. For each input frame, if two modalities have a strong complementary relationship, the gate selects the cross-attended feature, otherwise the non-attended feature. Also, the proposed gate allows the non-selected feature to escape through it with a small intensity, we call it leaky gate. This leaky feature makes effective regularization of the selected major feature. Therefore, our leaky gating makes cross-attention more adaptable and robust even when the modalities have a weak complementary relationship. The proposed leaky gated cross-attention provides a modality fusion module that is generally compatible with various temporal action localization methods.

While static inaccuracies of calibration targets have been addressed in previous works, to our knowledge, none of the existing approaches can capture time-varying, dynamic deformations. To achieve high-accuracy calibrations despite moving the target, we propose a way to explicitly model dynamic target deformations in camera calibration.

Specifically, we alternate the optimization process; while optimizing one of the streams, all views are mapped to one set of stream prototype vectors. Each of the assignments is predicted with all views except the one matching the prediction, pushing representations closer to their assigned prototypes. As a result, more efficient video embeddings with ingrained motion information are learned, without the explicit need for optical flow computation during inference.

To Miss-Attend Is to Misalign! Residual Self-Attentive Feature Alignment for Adapting Object Detectors,"Vaishnavi Khindkar, Chetan Arora, Vineeth N Balasubramanian, Anbumani Subramanian, Rohit Saluja, C.V. Jawahar"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 3632-3642","Advancements in adaptive object detection can lead to tremendous improvements in applications like autonomous navigation, as they alleviate the distributional shifts along the detection pipeline. Prior works adopt adversarial learning to align image features at global and local levels, yet the instance-specific misalignment persists. Also, adaptive object detection remains challenging due to visual diversity in background scenes and intricate combinations of objects. Motivated by structural importance, we aim to attend prominent instance-specific regions, overcoming the feature misalignment issue. We propose a novel resIduaL seLf-attentive featUre alignMEnt ( ILLUME ) method for adaptive object detection. ILLUME comprises Self-Attention Feature Map (SAFM) module that enhances structural attention to object-related regions and thereby generates domain invariant features. Our approach significantly reduces the domain distance with the improved feature alignment of the instances. Qualitative results demonstrate the ability of ILLUME to attend important object instances required for alignment. Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approaches.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Khindkar_To_Miss-Attend_Is_to_Misalign_Residual_Self-Attentive_Feature_Alignment_for_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
EZCrop: Energy-Zoned Channels for Robust Output Pruning,"Rui Lin, Jie Ran, Dongpeng Wang, King Hung Chiu, Ngai Wong"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 19-28","Recent results have revealed an interesting observation in a trained convolutional neural network (CNN), namely, the rank of a feature map channel matrix remains surprisingly constant despite the input images. This has led to an effective rank-based channel pruning algorithm, yet the constant rank phenomenon remains mysterious and unexplained. This work aims at demystifying and interpreting such rank behavior from a frequency-domain perspective, which as a bonus suggests an extremely efficient Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-based metric for measuring channel importance without explicitly computing its rank. We achieve remarkable CNN channel pruning based on this analytically sound and computationally efficient metric, and adopt it for repetitive pruning to demonstrate robustness via our scheme named Energy-Zoned Channels for Robust Output Pruning (EZCrop), which shows consistently better results than other state-of-the-art channel pruning methods.

Geometrically Adaptive Dictionary Attack on Face Recognition,"Junyoung Byun, Hyojun Go, Changick Kim"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 3021-3030","CNN-based face recognition models have brought remarkable performance improvement, but they are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Recent studies have shown that adversaries can fool the models even if they can only access the models' hard-label output. However, since many queries are needed to find imperceptible adversarial noise, reducing the number of queries is crucial for these attacks. In this paper, we point out two limitations of existing decision-based black-box attacks. We observe that they waste queries for background noise optimization, and they do not take advantage of adversarial perturbations generated for other images. We exploit 3D face alignment to overcome these limitations and propose a general strategy for query-efficient black-box attacks on face recognition named Geometrically Adaptive Dictionary Attack (GADA). Our core idea is to create an adversarial perturbation in the UV texture map and project it onto the face in the image. It greatly improves query efficiency by limiting the perturbation search space to the facial area and effectively recycling previous perturbations. We apply the GADA strategy to two existing attack methods and show overwhelming performance improvement in the experiments on the LFW and CPLFW datasets. Furthermore, we also present a novel attack strategy that can circumvent query similarity-based stateful detection that identifies the process of query-based black-box attacks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Byun_Geometrically_Adaptive_Dictionary_Attack_on_Face_Recognition_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
A Riemannian Framework for Analysis of Human Body Surface,"Emery Pierson, Mohamed Daoudi, Alice-Barbara Tumpach"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 2991-3000","We propose a novel framework for comparing 3D human shapes under the change of shape and pose. This problem is challenging since 3D human shapes vary significantly across subjects and body postures. We solve this problem by using a Riemannian approach. Our core contribution is the mapping of the human body surface to the space of metrics and normals. We equip this space with a family of Riemannian metrics, called Ebin (or DeWitt) metrics. We treat a human body surface as a point in a ""shape space"" equipped with a family of Riemmanian metrics. The family of metrics is invariant under rigid motions and reparametrizations; hence it induces a metric on the ""shape space"" of surfaces. Using the alignment of human bodies with a given template, we show that this family of metrics allows us to distinguish the changes in shape and pose. The proposed framework has several advantages. First, we define a family of metrics with desired invariant properties for the comparison of human shape. Second, we present an efficient framework to compute geodesic paths between human shape given the chosen metric. Third, this framework provides some basic tools for statistical shape analysis of human body surfaces. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework in pose and shape retrieval of human body.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Pierson_A_Riemannian_Framework_for_Analysis_of_Human_Body_Surface_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
Hyper-Convolution Networks for Biomedical Image Segmentation,"Tianyu Ma, Adrian V. Dalca, Mert R. Sabuncu"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 1933-1942","The convolution operation is a central building block of neural network architectures widely used in computer vision. The size of the convolution kernels determines both the expressiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNN), as well as the number of learnable parameters. Increasing the network capacity to capture rich pixel relationships requires increasing the number of learnable parameters, often leading to overfitting and/or lack of robustness. In this paper, we propose a powerful novel building block, the hyper-convolution, which implicitly represents the convolution kernel as a function of kernel coordinates. Hyper-convolutions enable decoupling the kernel size, and hence its receptive field, from the number of learnable parameters. In our experiments, focused on challenging biomedical image segmentation tasks, we demonstrate that replacing regular convolutions with hyper-convolutions leads to more efficient architectures that achieve improved accuracy. Our analysis also shows that learned hyper-convolutions are naturally regularized, which can offer better generalization performance. We believe that hyper-convolutions can be a powerful building block in future neural network architectures solving computer vision tasks.

AuxAdapt: Stable and Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Temporally Consistent Video Semantic Segmentation,"Yizhe Zhang, Shubhankar Borse, Hong Cai, Fatih Porikli"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 2339-2348","In video segmentation, generating temporally consistent results across frames is as important as achieving frame-wise accuracy. Existing methods rely either on optical flow regularization or fine-tuning with test data to attain temporal consistency. However, optical flow is not always avail-able and reliable. Besides, it is expensive to compute. Fine-tuning the original model in test time is cost sensitive. This paper presents an efficient, intuitive, and unsupervised online adaptation method, AuxAdapt, for improving the temporal consistency of most neural network models. It does not require optical flow and only takes one pass of the video. Since inconsistency mainly arises from the model's uncertainty in its output, we propose an adaptation scheme where the model learns from its own segmentation decisions as it streams a video, which allows producing more confident and temporally consistent labeling for similarly-looking pixels across frames. For stability and efficiency, we leverage a small auxiliary segmentation network (AuxNet) to assist with this adaptation. More specifically, AuxNet readjusts the decision of the original segmentation network (Main-Net) by adding its own estimations to that of MainNet. At every frame, only AuxNet is updated via back-propagation while keeping MainNet fixed. We extensively evaluate our test-time adaptation approach on standard video benchmarks, including Cityscapes, CamVid, and KITTI. The results demonstrate that our approach provides label-wise accurate, temporally consistent, and computationally efficient adaptation (5+ folds overhead reduction comparing to state-of-the-art test-time adaptation methods).",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Zhang_AuxAdapt_Stable_and_Efficient_Test-Time_Adaptation_for_Temporally_Consistent_Video_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
Busy-Quiet Video Disentangling for Video Classification,"Guoxi Huang, Adrian G. Bors"," Proceedings of the IEEE/CVF Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV), 2022, pp. 1341-1350","In video data, busy motion details from moving regions are conveyed within a specific frequency bandwidth in the frequency domain. Meanwhile, the rest of the frequencies of video data are encoded with quiet information with substantial redundancy, which causes low processing efficiency in existing video models that take as input raw RGB frames. In this paper, we consider allocating intenser computation for the processing of the important busy information and less computation for that of the quiet information. We design a trainable Motion Band-Pass Module (MBPM) for separating busy information from quiet information in raw video data. By embedding the MBPM into a two-pathway CNN architecture, we define a Busy-Quiet Net (BQN). The efficiency of BQN is determined by avoiding redundancy in the feature space processed by the two pathways: one operating on Quiet features of low-resolution, while the other processes Busy features. The proposed BQN outperforms many recent video processing models on Something-Something V1, Kinetics400, UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2022/html/Huang_Busy-Quiet_Video_Disentangling_for_Video_Classification_WACV_2022_paper.html,2022,wacv
